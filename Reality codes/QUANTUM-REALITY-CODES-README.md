# Quantum Reality Codes - Complete System

## 🌟 Overview

The Quantum Reality Codes system transforms your intentions into numerical frequencies using English Ordinal Gematria. These codes become exponentially more powerful as your community amplifies them through comments using the formula: **2^n - 1** (where n = number of comments).
