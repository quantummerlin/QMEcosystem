2. **No Clear Path** - Users don't know where to start
3. **Missing Achievement** - No dopamine hits from unlocking progress
4. **Shallow Engagement** - Users bounce without experiencing depth
5. **Lost Context** - Tools feel disconnected rather than integrated

## ❓ **Open Questions for You**

1. Should users be able to "skip ahead" with a donation/support?
2. How strict should unlocks be? (soft recommendation vs hard lock)
3. Should realms have separate progression? (unlock tools per realm)
4. Achievement rewards: just badges, or unlock exclusive content?
5. Social features: leaderboards, or keep it personal?

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this proposal
2. Decide on unlock philosophy (strict vs flexible)
3. Prioritize which achievements to build first
4. Begin implementation with Level 1 prototype
