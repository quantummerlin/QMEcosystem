                <p>The Chinese Zodiac follows a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by an animal. Combined with the five elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) rotating every 2 years, this creates a 60-year cycle of unique combinations that shape your personality, strengths, and life path.</p>

                title: "The Strategist's Spirit",
                hook: "The first gate opens, {preferredName}. You emerged in the Year of the Rat—pioneer of the twelve-year cycle, holder of the cunning flame. Your soul carries the pattern of initiative, intelligence, and elegant survival.",
                core_identity: "You ARE the quick mind, the resourceful navigator, the one who finds pathways invisible to others. Your intelligence isn't merely academic—it's street-smart, intuitive, practical. You assess situations rapidly, finding solutions where others see only walls.",
                external: "Others perceive you as clever, charming, and socially adept. You navigate conversations with wit, remembering details about people that make them feel genuinely seen. Your warmth draws people in while your sharpness earns respect.",
                behavior: "You naturally seek advantage, opportunity, and strategic positioning. Social situations become chess games you play instinctively. You build networks, gather resources, and create security through intelligence rather than force.",
                strength: "Your adaptability runs bone-deep. When circumstances shift, you pivot without hesitation. This flexibility in an unpredictable world is survival magic—you thrive where others merely cope.",
                shadow: "Opportunism can shade into manipulation. Your ability to read situations may tempt you toward shortcuts that compromise integrity. Overthinking breeds unnecessary anxiety about problems that don't yet exist.",
                integration: "Channel your strategic mind toward ethical advantage. Use your social intelligence to create genuine connection, not just networking. Let your resourcefulness serve collective good alongside personal security.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become paranoid, overly calculating, or anxious about worst-case scenarios. Your quick mind spirals into worry loops. Ground through action rather than analysis.",
                misread: "Your charm may be seen as manipulation. Your resourcefulness might appear as scheming. Your caution could seem like hoarding. Show your genuine warmth beneath the strategic surface.",
                relationships: "In love, you're passionate and devoted once trust is established. You show care through thoughtful gestures and anticipating needs. You need a partner who matches your mental agility and appreciates your protective instincts.",
                growth: "Learn that security comes from inner resourcefulness, not just external accumulation. The highest expression isn't just survival—it's using your gifts to help others navigate their challenges too.",
                power: "Trust your instincts about opportunities. Your pattern-recognition is real. Take calculated risks, build strategic alliances, and know that your ability to see ahead serves your success, {preferredName}.",
                somatic: "Your nervous system runs quick and alert—you may carry tension in shoulders and jaw. Ground through physical activity that requires strategy and agility.",
                reflection: "Where am I using cleverness to avoid vulnerability? What would genuine connection look like beyond networking? How can my resourcefulness serve beyond myself?"

                external: "Others perceive you as reliable, trustworthy, and solid. People know they can count on your word. You're the foundation others build upon, the rock in chaos.",
                behavior: "You naturally create systems, establish routines, and work methodically toward long-term objectives. You prefer proven methods over experiments. Your approach is thorough rather than flashy.",
                strength: "Your stamina and determination are extraordinary. You can sustain effort that exhausts others. Hard work doesn't deplete you—it's your natural expression. You build things meant to last.",
                shadow: "Stubbornness can calcify into rigidity. You may resist change even when evidence demands adaptation. Seriousness can squeeze out joy—you work so hard that you forget to play.",
                integration: "Use your steadfast nature wisely. Know when to hold course and when flexibility serves better. Let your building instinct include creating space for rest and celebration.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become more rigid, silently suffering, or explosively angry after long suppression. Learn to release tension before it builds to breaking point.",
                misread: "Your steadiness may be seen as boring. Your commitment might appear as lacking imagination. Your traditional values could seem like fear of change.",
                relationships: "In love, you're loyal beyond question. You show devotion through providing, protecting, and showing up consistently. You need a partner who appreciates depth over excitement.",
                growth: "Learn that adaptation isn't betrayal of your nature. The highest expression isn't just endurance—it's choosing where to invest your mighty persistence.",

                somatic: "Your body holds tension in lower back and shoulders from carrying heavy loads. Regular rest is essential—you'll push through signals until forced to stop.",
                reflection: "Where is my stubbornness blocking necessary change? What would happen if I rested without guilt? How can I build in joy alongside achievement?"

                behavior: "You naturally compete, challenge, and push boundaries. You go all-in with fierce intensity when committed. Independence drives every choice—you'd rather fail on your own terms.",
                strength: "Your bravery allows action where others freeze. You take risks, stand up for the vulnerable, and face challenges that terrify lesser spirits. This courage creates breakthroughs.",
                shadow: "Impulsiveness creates preventable damage. Your intensity can overwhelm those who operate at lower voltage. Pride may prevent admitting mistakes or accepting help.",
                integration: "Channel your warrior energy with wisdom. Learn which battles deserve your fire and which deplete you needlessly. Use your leadership to empower others.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become aggressive, reckless, or explosively angry. You attack when cornered rather than strategize. Create space between trigger and response.",
                misread: "Your confidence may be seen as arrogance. Your intensity might appear as inability to relax. Your independence could seem like inability to collaborate.",
                relationships: "In love, you're passionate and exciting—life with you is never boring. You need a partner confident enough to be your equal, someone who celebrates your strength.",
                growth: "Learn that vulnerability enhances rather than diminishes your power. The highest expression isn't constant fighting—it's choosing your battles wisely.",
                power: "Trust your instincts about when to strike. Your courage opens doors sealed to the timid. Lead the charges that matter, {preferredName}.",
                somatic: "Your body runs hot and ready for action. You may carry tension from restrained energy. Physical expression—sports, martial arts—is essential for balance.",
                reflection: "Where is my intensity overwhelming people I care about? What would it mean to be powerful without proving it? Which battles am I fighting that aren't really mine?"
