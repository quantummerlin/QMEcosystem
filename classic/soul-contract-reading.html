                external: "Others see your confidence and self-reliance. They may not understand that this strength was forged through situations where you had no choice but to stand alone. Your independence inspires them even as it intimidates.",
                behavior: "You naturally take charge, initiate action, and resist being controlled. This isn't personality—it's soul curriculum. Every time you lead, you fulfill your contract.",
                strength: "Your capacity for original thought and courageous action was built through challenge. You can pioneer paths others fear to walk because your soul specifically trained for this.",
                shadow: "Your contract's shadow is isolation disguised as independence. You may struggle to receive help or admit vulnerability because your training was so focused on self-reliance.",
                integration: "Fulfill your contract by leading others toward their own independence, not just demonstrating yours. True mastery of the Pioneer Contract means empowering others to stand alone too.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become controlling, dismissive of others, or stubbornly isolated. Remember that interdependence is advanced independence, not its opposite.",
                misread: "Your independence may be seen as inability to connect. Your strength might appear as hardness. Your leadership could seem like domination.",
                relationships: "Your contract tests you in partnership—can you remain an individual while truly merging with another? The ultimate Pioneer lesson is independence within intimacy.",

                behavior: "You naturally mediate, consider others' feelings, and seek win-win solutions. This isn't weakness—it's advanced soul curriculum.",
                strength: "Your emotional intelligence and sensitivity were developed through challenging relationships. You read situations others miss because your training was intensive.",
                shadow: "Your contract's shadow is self-erasure disguised as harmony. You may disappear into others' needs, losing yourself to maintain peace that isn't real peace.",
                integration: "Fulfill your contract by creating genuine harmony that includes your voice. True mastery means peace that doesn't require your silence.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become passive-aggressive, overly yielding, or paralyzed by others' emotions. Remember that your needs matter in the equation.",
                misread: "Your patience may be seen as pushover energy. Your sensitivity might appear as weakness. Your cooperation could seem like lack of conviction.",
                relationships: "Your contract fulfills through partnership—but tests whether you can remain yourself while deeply connecting. The ultimate Peacemaker lesson is harmony that includes you.",
                growth: "Your soul's evolution comes through learning that peace without truth is false peace, that cooperation includes advocating for yourself.",

                core_identity: "You ARE the creator, the one who came to learn expression through suppression. Your soul chose circumstances that would require you to find your voice when silenced, to create when criticized.",
                external: "Others see your creativity and charisma. They may not understand that this expressiveness was earned through experiences of being shut down. Your sparkle is victory, not gift.",

                integration: "Fulfill your contract by creating work that moves people, not just entertains them. True mastery means expression with depth, not just volume.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become scattered, attention-seeking, or trapped in performance rather than authenticity. Remember that your worth isn't in others' applause.",
                misread: "Your creativity may be seen as frivolity. Your socializing might appear as avoidance. Your expressiveness could seem like attention-seeking.",
                relationships: "Your contract tests whether you can be truly seen—not just your sparkle but your depths. The ultimate Artist lesson is authentic expression of all of you, including the shadows.",

                core_identity: "You ARE the manifester, the one who came to learn creation through limitation. Your soul chose circumstances that would require you to build patiently when you wanted instant results.",
                external: "Others see your reliability and work ethic. They may depend on you for stability they take for granted. Your steadiness is earned, not natural.",
                behavior: "You naturally create systems, follow through on commitments, and do the work others avoid. This isn't drudgery—it's mastery practice.",
                strength: "Your discipline and persistence were developed through obstacles. You can build what others abandon because your training was in finishing, not just starting.",
                shadow: "Your contract's shadow is rigidity disguised as discipline. You may cling to structure when flexibility is needed, confusing stubbornness with persistence.",
                integration: "Fulfill your contract by building things that matter, not just things that last. True mastery means foundations that support life, not restrict it.",
