        const interpretations = {
            "Aries": `{preferredName}, your Mercury is in Aries, giving you a quick, direct, and pioneering mind. You think fast, speak boldly, and have little patience for lengthy explanations or beating around the bush.

Your communication style is refreshingly direct. You say what you mean without diplomatic softening, which others appreciate for its honesty—even when it occasionally startles them. You'd rather offend with truth than comfort with evasion.

You're a mental pioneer who loves new ideas. The first phase of any concept excites you most—brainstorming, initiating, breaking new ground. You get bored once the novelty wears off and details need handling.

Your mind works competitively. Debates energize you; you love the mental sparring of argument. You're not afraid to defend unpopular positions and can think quickly under pressure.

Learning happens best through action. You grasp concepts by doing, not by reading endless theory. Hands-on experience teaches you faster than any lecture.

Decisions come quickly—sometimes too quickly. Your mental impulsiveness means you may speak before thinking or commit before considering consequences. You'd rather correct mistakes than deliberate endlessly.

The shadow of Mercury in Aries is mental impatience and combativeness. You may interrupt others, dominate conversations, or dismiss ideas too quickly.

Your mental gift is: INITIATING ideas, cutting through complexity, and speaking with courageous honesty.`,

            "Taurus": `{preferredName}, your Mercury is in Taurus, giving you a deliberate, practical, and grounded mind. You think slowly but thoroughly, and once you've formed an opinion, you hold it with remarkable tenacity.

Your communication style is measured and concrete. You speak in practical terms, preferring real-world examples to abstract theories. Your words have weight because you don't waste them on empty chatter.

You're a sensory thinker who understands through experience. Concepts become real for you when you can see, touch, or apply them. Pure abstraction leaves you cold; practical application illuminates.

Your mind values stability and resists rapid change. New ideas get tested against common sense before acceptance. You're not closed-minded, just methodical—you need time to integrate new information.

Learning happens through repetition and application. You remember what you've practiced, built, or experienced physically. Your memory for sensory details is remarkable.

Decisions take time, and you resist being rushed. You need to feel your way to conclusions, not just think them. Once decided, however, you're immovable.

The shadow of Mercury in Taurus is mental stubbornness and resistance to new ideas. You may cling to outdated thinking simply because it's familiar.

Your mental gift is: PRACTICAL wisdom, turning ideas into tangible reality, and reliable, grounded thinking.`,

Your communication style is lively and varied. You can talk to anyone about anything, adapting your language to your audience. You're witty, articulate, and never at a loss for words.

You're a mental omnivore who devours information. Everything interests you—at least briefly. You read widely, learn quickly, and make surprising connections between disparate fields.

Your mind loves variety and movement. Focusing on one thing for extended periods is challenging; you think better when juggling multiple projects and ideas simultaneously.

Learning happens through conversation and exploration. You understand by discussing, questioning, and examining multiple perspectives. Teaching others solidifies your own knowledge.

Decisions involve gathering information—sometimes too much. You may struggle with analysis paralysis or change your mind frequently as new data arrives.

            "Cancer": `{preferredName}, your Mercury is in Cancer, giving you an intuitive, emotional, and retentive mind. You think with your feelings, and your memory for emotional experiences is extraordinary.

Your communication style is personal and nurturing. You connect information to feelings and relationships. When you speak, you create emotional resonance, making others feel understood.

You're a subjective thinker who filters everything through personal experience. Impersonal, abstract logic doesn't convince you—you need to feel the truth of something before accepting it.

Your mind is protective of what it holds. You guard your thoughts and opinions, sharing them only when you feel safe. With trusted others, you open up beautifully.

Learning happens through emotional engagement. You remember what moved you, what connected to your personal story. Dry facts without emotional context fade quickly.

Decisions are influenced by feelings and intuition more than pure logic. You know things without knowing how you know them. Trust your gut—it's remarkably accurate.

The shadow of Mercury in Cancer is moodiness affecting thought and communication. Your thinking may become clouded by emotions, or you may struggle to separate feelings from facts.

Your mental gift is: REMEMBERING deeply, communicating with emotional intelligence, and thinking that honors the personal and subjective.`,

            "Leo": `{preferredName}, your Mercury is in Leo, giving you a confident, creative, and dramatic mind. You think in terms of self-expression, and your communication has natural flair and authority.

You're a creative thinker who approaches problems with originality. Standard solutions bore you—you want to put your unique stamp on ideas. Your mind is drawn to creative expression.

Your thoughts have pride attached. Your opinions matter to you, and criticism of your ideas can feel personal. You defend your mental positions with dignity.

Learning happens through play and creative engagement. Dry instruction dulls your mind; make it a game or creative challenge and you excel.

Decisions connect to your sense of identity and pride. You choose what feels authentic and expressive of who you are, not just what's logical.

The shadow of Mercury in Leo is intellectual arrogance and inflexibility. You may become attached to being right, unable to admit error without feeling diminished.

            "Virgo": `{preferredName}, your Mercury is in Virgo—its home sign and exaltation—giving you an analytical, precise, and practical mind. You notice details others miss and excel at organizing information.

Your communication style is clear and exact. You choose words carefully, say precisely what you mean, and appreciate precision in others. Sloppy thinking or communication irritates you.

You're an analytical thinker who naturally breaks things into components. You see how parts fit together, what's working and what's not, where improvement is needed.

Your mind is service-oriented. You think about how to be useful, how to improve things, how to solve practical problems. Abstract philosophy interests you less than applicable knowledge.

Learning happens through systematic study and practice. You're thorough, methodical, and willing to put in the work that mastery requires.

Decisions involve careful analysis. You weigh pros and cons, consider practical implications, and prefer informed choices to impulsive ones.

The shadow of Mercury in Virgo is over-criticism and mental anxiety. You may become paralyzed by perfectionism or constantly critique yourself and others.

Learning happens through discussion and partnership. You think better when you have someone to talk through ideas with. Collaborative learning suits you.

Decisions are challenging because you see merit in multiple options. You may delay choosing to avoid conflict or regret. Deadlines help you commit.

The shadow of Mercury in Libra is indecisiveness and people-pleasing in communication. You may say what others want to hear rather than what you truly think.

Your communication style is intense and probing. You ask the questions others avoid, speak with emotional depth, and have little tolerance for superficial chat.

You're a detective thinker who investigates relentlessly. You won't rest until you've gotten to the bottom of things. Mysteries, psychology, and hidden motivations fascinate you.

Your mind is private and strategic. You share your thoughts selectively, revealing only what serves your purposes. You think several moves ahead.

Learning happens through deep immersion. You prefer to master one thing thoroughly than dabble in many. Depth over breadth is your path.
