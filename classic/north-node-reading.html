                core_identity: "Your North Node in Aries calls you toward independence, courage, and bold self-assertion. You carry South Node gifts from Libra — natural diplomacy, partnership skills, and the ability to see all sides — but your soul's growth lies in developing a fierce, unapologetic sense of self.",
                external: "Others may initially see you as accommodating and relationship-focused, but your destiny pulls you toward standing alone when necessary, speaking your truth, and leading rather than following.",
                behavior: "Your soul's evolutionary direction: From people-pleasing to self-honoring. You're learning to act first and ask permission never, to value your own needs as much as others', and to embrace healthy conflict as a path to authenticity.",
                strength: "The courage to be yourself in a world that rewards accommodation. Your gift is pioneering — starting what hasn't been started, asserting what hasn't been said.",
                shadow: "The familiar trap: Falling back into Libra patterns of over-compromise, waiting for others' approval, losing yourself in relationships, or avoiding conflict at the cost of your truth.",
                integration: "Your South Node diplomacy becomes a superpower when combined with North Node courage. You can fight for what's right while still understanding all perspectives — the warrior-diplomat.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may retreat to people-pleasing and indecision. Notice when you're asking 'what do you think?' instead of knowing what YOU think.",
                misread: "Others may see selfishness when you're actually learning healthy self-assertion. Your boundaries are not betrayal — they're your curriculum.",
                relationships: "Paradoxically, your relationships improve as you become more independent. Partners respect you more when you stop disappearing into the 'we' — you're learning that two whole people make better partnerships than two half-selves.",
                growth: "Take initiative without waiting for approval. Assert your needs clearly and early. Embrace healthy conflict as clarifying. Develop a strong sense of 'I am' that doesn't need external validation. Lead when called.",
                power: "When you fully embody your North Node, you become a force of authentic presence — someone who inspires others to find their own courage by modeling what it looks like to be unapologetically yourself.",
                somatic: "You feel your North Node activation in your head and muscles — sudden urges to act, heat in your body when you speak truth, energy surges when you take charge.",

You carry South Node gifts from Scorpio — deep psychological insight, comfort with transformation, and investigative power — but your soul's growth lies in cultivating peace, patience, and appreciation for life's simple gifts.",
                external: "Others may initially experience your intensity and depth, but your destiny pulls you toward becoming a grounding presence — someone who embodies calm, builds lasting value, and trusts in abundance.",
                behavior: "Your soul's evolutionary direction: From crisis to serenity. You're learning to trust that not everything needs to be transformed, that simple pleasures have profound value, and that building is as important as destroying.",
                strength: "The power to create lasting stability from inner peace. Your gift is building — creating enduring value, cultivating resources, and demonstrating that security comes from within.",
                shadow: "The familiar trap: Falling back into Scorpio patterns of drama addiction, crisis-seeking, obsessive investigation, or the belief that only intensity is real. You may create upheaval when things get 'too quiet.'",
                integration: "Your South Node depth becomes a superpower when grounded in Taurean stability. You can understand the deepest truths while maintaining peace — the mystic-gardener who tends both souls and soil.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may create crisis or seek intensity to feel 'alive.' Notice when you're stirring drama instead of cultivating calm.",
                misread: "Others may see avoidance when you're actually choosing peace. Your simplicity isn't shallow — it's hard-won wisdom about what actually matters.",
                relationships: "Your relationships thrive when you stop testing them with intensity. Partners feel safe with you when you offer steady presence rather than constant transformation — you're learning that love can be quiet and still be deep.",
                growth: "Cultivate inner peace as a daily practice. Develop your own resources and values independent of others. Appreciate simple pleasures without guilt. Build something lasting rather than constantly reinventing. Trust in abundance.",
                power: "When you fully embody your North Node, you become an anchor of peace in chaos — someone whose groundedness helps others find their own stability, whose self-worth inspires others to value themselves.",
                somatic: "You feel your North Node activation in your throat and body sensations — pleasure in eating, touching, sensing; calm settling in your nervous system; feet connecting to earth.",
