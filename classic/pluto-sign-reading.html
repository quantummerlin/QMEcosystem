Your cohort brings death and rebirth to concepts of will, courage, and personal power. You don't wait for transformation—you charge at it. Your deepest power lies in your willingness to act when others freeze, to pioneer through fear rather than around it.",
                external: "Others sense your fierce transformative energy, your willingness to confront what everyone else avoids. Your power appears as courage, as initiative, as the one who moves first into the unknown.",
                behavior: "You transform through action. You're drawn to confrontation, to initiating change, to breaking through what holds others back. Passivity feels like death to you.",

                shadow: "When unintegrated, you may confuse aggression with power, act without wisdom, or use anger as a substitute for genuine transformation. Your rage can destroy what needs preserving.",
                integration: "Balance action with reflection. Your courage is sacred when guided by wisdom. Learn that some transformations require patience, not force.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become violent in action or word, attack preemptively, or create conflict to avoid feeling powerless.",
                misread: "Others may see you as aggressive when you're actually courageous, or as destructive when you're clearing what must die for new life to emerge.",
                relationships: "You seek partners who can match your intensity without being destroyed by it. You transform others through challenging them to find their own courage.",
                growth: "Your evolution involves learning that true power sometimes means restraint, that wisdom guides courage, that not every battle needs fighting.",
                power: "{preferredName}, your transformative gift is phoenix courage—you die and are reborn through action, teaching your generation that power comes from willingness to face fear directly.",

Your cohort brings death and rebirth to economic systems, to what we consider valuable, to how we relate to nature and material security. You possess the power to transform the physical world.",
                external: "Others sense your deep relationship with material power—wealth, resources, the tangible. Your transformative energy appears as financial acumen, as understanding of what truly holds value.",

                shadow: "When unintegrated, you may hoard compulsively, use wealth as control, or become so attached to material security that you resist all transformation. Greed can consume you.",
                integration: "Balance material power with detachment. Your ability to transform resources serves evolution only when you don't become attached to what you build.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may cling to possessions, attempt to control through wealth, or become paralyzed by fear of material loss.",
                misread: "Others may see you as materialistic when you're actually understanding the deep power of material reality, or as greedy when you're transforming resource patterns.",
                relationships: "You seek partners who respect your need for material security while challenging your attachment to it. You transform others through showing them new relationships with value.",
                growth: "Your evolution involves learning that true security is internal, that the power to transform matter ultimately means releasing attachment to it.",
                power: "{preferredName}, your transformative gift is material alchemy—you revolutionize how your generation relates to value, resources, and the physical world.",

                core_identity: "With Pluto in Gemini, you belong to a generation (1884-1914) that transforms through revolutionary changes in communication, information, and thought itself. Your cohort brings death and rebirth to how we think, speak, and share ideas. You possess the power to transform minds, to use words as instruments of profound change.",
                external: "Others sense your mental intensity, your ideas that cut through confusion and expose hidden truths. Your transformative energy appears as powerful communication, as thought that changes everything.",
                behavior: "You transform through ideas and communication. You're drawn to exposing hidden information, revolutionizing how we think, and using words as tools of deep change.",
                strength: "Your gift is transforming thought—the power to destroy false ideas and build new mental frameworks, to communicate truths that alter consciousness.",
                shadow: "When unintegrated, you may manipulate through words, use information as a weapon for control, or become obsessed with secrets while missing deeper truths.",
                integration: "Balance mental power with heart wisdom. Your ability to transform through ideas serves evolution only when guided by compassion, not just cleverness.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may spread damaging information, use communication to wound, or escape into mental complexity to avoid emotional truth.",
                misread: "Others may see you as manipulative when you're actually revealing hidden truths, or as intellectually cold when you're processing intense transformation through the mind.",
                relationships: "You seek partners who can match your mental intensity. You transform others by exposing the ideas that limit them and offering more powerful frameworks.",
