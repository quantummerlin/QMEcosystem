                external: "Others experience you as dynamic, decisive, and sometimes intimidating. When you enter a room, people feel the energy shift. Your presence announces itself with undeniable force.",
                behavior: "You don't hesitate. When you want something, you go after it NOW. Analysis paralysis is foreign to you — you'd rather act and adjust than plan endlessly. You start while others are still thinking.",
                strength: "Your courage to act. You're the one who initiates while others deliberate. Your anger is hot but brief — five minutes later, you've moved on to the next conquest.",
                shadow: "Impulsiveness and unnecessary aggression. You may act before thinking, creating problems. You might pick fights just to feel alive, burning bridges you'll later need.",
                integration: "Learn patience and strategic thinking. Your power amplifies when directed rather than scattered. Not every battle needs to be fought today — some victories require timing.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you become more aggressive, impulsive, and prone to explosive outbursts. You may create enemies where none existed, fighting shadows.",
                misread: "People see aggression when you're actually expressing pure life force. Your intensity isn't hostility — it's aliveness at its most raw and honest.",
                relationships: "You pursue boldly, finding the chase exciting. You need partners who can match your energy and aren't intimidated by your intensity. Passion runs hot and direct.",
                growth: "Learn that waiting is sometimes the most powerful action. Strategic patience multiplies your natural force. The greatest warriors choose their battles wisely.",
                power: "When you fully own your warrior nature, you become the initiator — the one who makes things happen while others hesitate, leading charges that change everything.",

                integration: "Learn that flexibility isn't weakness. Sometimes the strongest move is adaptation. Security includes the ability to flow when circumstances demand it.",
                stress: "Under pressure, your anger builds slowly but explodes devastatingly. You become the raging bull, terrifying in intensity when you finally release.",
                misread: "People see slowness as weakness. They underestimate you until it's too late to stop your advance. Your patience is power, not passivity.",
                relationships: "You're sensual, patient, and physically oriented. You take your time, enjoying every sensation. Quick encounters don't satisfy — you want full embodiment.",
                growth: "Learn that letting go of goals that no longer serve you isn't failure. Persistence becomes stubbornness when the goal has changed. Adapt to grow.",
                power: "When you fully own your unstoppable nature, you become the force that builds empires through patient, persistent effort that compounds over time.",
                somatic: "You feel drive in your body's density, your grip strength, your physical stamina — power stored in muscles waiting to be deployed.",

                behavior: "You fight with language — arguing circles around opponents, undercutting them with quips, talking your way out of (or into) anything. Intelligence is your weapon.",
                strength: "Your mental speed and verbal precision. You win through intelligence and communication. You're brilliant in short bursts, adaptable, and mentally agile.",

                integration: "Learn to focus your brilliant mind. Depth multiplies surface breadth. Complete some of what you start before moving to the next thing.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you become more scattered, verbally aggressive, and prone to nervous exhaustion. You may overthink until paralyzed by options.",
                misread: "People see inconsistency as unreliability. Your natural rhythm is juggling multiple pursuits — this is strength, not weakness. Variety is your fuel.",
