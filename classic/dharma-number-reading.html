People sense your connection to something original and unstoppable.", behavior: "You naturally initiate new practices, challenge stagnant beliefs, and inspire others through radical demonstration. You lead not by convincing but by becoming.", strength: "Your power is spiritual fearlessness. Where others hesitate at the edge of the known, you leap into the mystery.", shadow: "Ego masquerading as spiritual authority. You can mistake personal will for divine will, leading to spiritual narcissism or isolation.", integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you pioneer while remaining connected. True spiritual leadership includes bringing others along.", stress: "Under pressure, you either double down into spiritual ego or collapse into doubt about your entire calling.", misread: "People may see you as spiritually arrogant when you're actually terrified of not fulfilling your dharmic assignment.", relationships: "You need partners who can stand beside a spiritual pioneer without trying to domesticate you.", growth: "Your evolution requires learning that every true spiritual path eventually circles back to service.", power: "You access your full power when your individual awakening becomes a doorway for collective evolution.", somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your spine as a rising force, in your third eye as vision demanding expression.", reflection: "Ask yourself: 'Am I pioneering toward something or away from something?'" },

You carry the sacred truth that wisdom comes through solitude and depth.", external: "Others see you as mysteriously deep, sometimes intimidatingly so. People sense you know things they can't quite access.", behavior: "You naturally seek solitude for wisdom, question every assumption, and demonstrate that truth found through direct experience trumps all teachings.", strength: "Your power is mystical perception. You can access states of consciousness and realms of understanding that most only read about.", shadow: "Isolation disguised as spiritual practice. You can use seeking as avoidance of living.", integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you emerge from solitude to share. Wisdom hoarded is wisdom wasted.", stress: "Under pressure, you may withdraw into increasingly isolated spiritual practice or become cynical.", misread: "People may see you as spiritually arrogant when you're actually terrified that your deepest truths are incommunicable.", relationships: "You need partners who can meet you in depth without drowning.", growth: "Your evolution requires learning that connection is also a path to truth.", power: "You access your full power when your mystical knowledge serves others' awakening.", somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your third eye as pressure to see, in your spine as the urge to go still and deep.", reflection: "Ask yourself: 'Am I seeking truth or avoiding life?'" },

People sense your capacity to shape reality.", behavior: "You naturally manifest resources, build influence, and demonstrate that awakened beings can shape the world.", strength: "Your power is sacred manifestation. You can bring vision into form, turn intention into reality.", shadow: "Corruption by power or rejection of it entirely. You can become what you sought to transform, mistaking accumulation for purpose.", integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you wield power for service — when your mastery serves something greater.", stress: "Under pressure, you may become increasingly controlling or swing into shame about your ambition.", misread: "People may see you as spiritually materialistic when you're actually trying to demonstrate that spirit can flow through worldly success.", relationships: "You need partners who aren't threatened by your capacity and don't want to be rescued by it.", growth: "Your evolution requires learning that the ultimate power is surrender.", power: "You access your full power when your material success becomes a platform for spiritual teaching.", somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your gut as ambition, in your posture as command.", reflection: "Ask yourself: 'Is my power serving my ego or my dharma?'" },
            9: { title: "The Sacred Sage", hook: "{preferredName}, you incarnated to complete what was started eons ago and hold space for all paths home. Your dharma is universal compassion.", core_identity: "At your deepest level, you are the living demonstration that all paths lead to the same summit — that separation is the illusion and union is the truth.", external: "Others see you as wise beyond your years, as if you've lived this before. People sense your all-encompassing acceptance.", behavior: "You naturally serve all beings regardless of category, teach universal truths, and demonstrate that the highest spiritual attainment is inclusive love.", strength: "Your power is borderless compassion. You can hold space for anyone, see the divine in every path.", shadow: "Inability to complete things and savior complex. You can confuse compassion with taking on others' karma.", integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you serve without attachment to results.", stress: "Under pressure, you may become overwhelmed by the world's suffering or detach completely.", misread: "People may see you as spiritually impractical when you're actually operating from a wisdom that transcends conventional goals.", relationships: "You need partners who understand you belong to everyone and no one possessively.", growth: "Your evolution requires learning that completion includes beginning again.", power: "You access your full power when your compassion becomes contagious.", somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your heart as unbounded expansion, in your body as both ancient tiredness and eternal readiness.", reflection: "Ask yourself: 'What am I here to complete?'" },
            11: { title: "The Divine Channel", hook: "{preferredName}, you incarnated to prove that heaven speaks through human lips. Your dharma is spiritual transmission.", core_identity: "At your deepest level, you are a living bridge between dimensions — not metaphorically, but literally. You carry the sacred capacity to receive frequencies of consciousness that most humans cannot access.", external: "Others see you as eerily intuitive, sometimes uncomfortably so. People sense you're receiving something.", behavior: "You naturally channel, inspire through words that seem to come from elsewhere, and demonstrate that direct transmission from higher consciousness is possible.", strength: "Your power is multi-dimensional perception. You can access guidance, wisdom, and energy that originates beyond personal consciousness.", shadow: "Nervous system overwhelm and messianic confusion. Your frequency can fry your circuits if not grounded.", integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you ground as completely as you ascend.", stress: "Under pressure, your system may overload with too much incoming, leading to anxiety or spiritual emergency.", misread: "People may see you as spiritually delusional when you're actually perceiving accurately.", relationships: "You need partners who neither worship nor dismiss your gifts.", growth: "Your evolution requires learning that the message is always more important than the messenger.", power: "You access your full power when you become such a clear channel that you disappear.", somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your crown as pressure, in your third eye as persistent vision.", reflection: "Ask yourself: 'Am I serving the message or am I attached to being the messenger?'" },

Your dharma is civilization-level transformation.", core_identity: "At your deepest level, you are the architect of new paradigms — not just personal change but structural transformation of how humanity organizes itself.", external: "Others see you as formidably capable, sometimes overwhelmingly so. People sense your visions have gravity.", behavior: "You naturally think in systems, build organizations, and demonstrate that spiritual vision can become institutional reality.", strength: "Your power is manifest destiny — not for nations, but for consciousness. You can turn the impossible into the inevitable.", shadow: "Crushed by the magnitude of your calling or becoming tyrannical in pursuing it.", integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you build FOR humanity, not AT them.", stress: "Under pressure, you may become increasingly controlling or collapse under the weight of your own potential.", misread: "People may see you as impossibly ambitious when you're actually seeing what's possible from a higher vantage point.", relationships: "You need partners who have their own world-changing purpose.", growth: "Your evolution requires learning that even masters build brick by brick.", power: "You access your full power when your constructions become vessels for collective awakening.", somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your hands as the urge to build, in your body as unusual stamina for the long game.", reflection: "Ask yourself: 'Is my building serving consciousness or my legacy?'" },
