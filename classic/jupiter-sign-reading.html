                core_identity: "Your Jupiter is in Aries, blessing you with luck through bold initiative, courage, and pioneering spirit. Fortune favors you when you take the first step, lead the charge, and trust your independent instincts.",
                external: "Others experience you as inspiring in your willingness to act. Your courage is contagious. You show people what's possible when someone is willing to move first.",
                behavior: "You attract abundance through action. While others plan and hesitate, you move—and the universe rewards your courage with opportunities that wouldn't appear to more cautious souls.",
                strength: "Your philosophical outlook is optimistic and competitive. You believe life rewards the brave, that fortune favors the bold, and that individuals shape their destiny through action.",
                shadow: "The glitch: reckless overconfidence. You may take foolish risks, overestimate your abilities, or burn through opportunities without appreciating them.",
                integration: "Learn that some opportunities require patience as well as courage. Strategic boldness multiplies the luck that impulsive action can waste.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may take increasingly reckless risks, gamble what you can't afford to lose, or rush into situations that need more thought.",
                misread: "People see recklessness when you're actually demonstrating faith in action. Your bold moves aren't stupid — they're strategically courageous.",
                relationships: "You expand through partners who match your boldness. You need relationships that encourage adventure, not ones that try to play it safe.",
                growth: "Learn that maintaining what you've started requires different energy than starting it. Completion deserves the same faith as initiation.",
                power: "When you fully own your bold vision, you become the one who starts movements — inspiring others through your courageous example.",
                somatic: "You feel expansion in your muscles and forward momentum — physical pull toward action, restlessness when held back.",
                reflection: "Am I taking this risk from courage or impulsiveness? What would strategic boldness look like here?"

                title: "The Patient Builder",
                hook: "Your luck compounds like interest — slow at first, then unstoppable. Patience IS your fortune.",
                core_identity: "Your Jupiter is in Taurus, blessing you with luck through patience, persistence, and building tangible value. Fortune favors you when you take your time, invest wisely, and trust steady growth.",
                external: "Others experience you as a demonstration that slow and steady really does win. Your patient accumulation shows what's possible through sustained effort.",
                behavior: "You attract abundance through quality over speed. You build wealth slowly but surely, accumulating resources through patient effort rather than get-rich-quick schemes.",
                strength: "Your philosophical outlook is grounded and pleasure-positive. You believe life is meant to be enjoyed, that the physical world is good, and that abundance is natural.",
                shadow: "The glitch: material excess and spiritual complacency. You may over-indulge, become greedy, or confuse physical comfort with genuine growth.",
                integration: "Learn that true abundance includes non-material wealth. Security is important AND life offers riches beyond what money can buy.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may grip tighter to material security, becoming inflexible or refusing to risk what you've built even when risk is wise.",
                misread: "People see slowness as lack of ambition. Your patient approach is actually sophisticated — you understand compound growth.",
                relationships: "You expand through partners who value stability and quality. You need relationships that appreciate slow building over quick thrills.",
                growth: "Learn that some growth requires letting go of accumulated security. Expansion sometimes means risking comfort.",
                power: "When you fully own your patient nature, you become the one who builds empires — demonstrating the power of consistent, quality effort.",
                somatic: "You feel expansion in your body's comfort — physical satisfaction, groundedness, sensory richness.",
                reflection: "Am I building because I value quality or because I fear risk? What would abundant generosity feel like?"

                title: "The Intellectual Expander",

                core_identity: "Your Jupiter is in Gemini, blessing you with luck through learning, communication, and intellectual versatility. Fortune favors you when you stay curious and make connections.",
                external: "Others experience you as a source of interesting information and valuable connections. You know something about everything and someone for every need.",
                behavior: "You attract abundance through your mind and voice. Writing, speaking, teaching, networking—these are your wealth-generating activities.",
                strength: "Your philosophical outlook is eclectic and questioning. You believe truth comes from many sources, that learning never ends, and that the universe is endlessly fascinating.",
                shadow: "The glitch: scattered energy and superficiality. You may spread yourself too thin, know a little about everything but master nothing, or talk more than act.",
                integration: "Learn that depth amplifies breadth. Choose some subjects for mastery while keeping others for curiosity. Focus multiplies your luck.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may scatter further, gathering more information without acting, or make promises you can't keep.",
                misread: "People see inconsistency as unreliability. Your versatility is actually rare and valuable — you see connections others miss.",
                relationships: "You expand through partners who appreciate your curiosity. You need relationships that encourage learning and variety.",
                growth: "Learn that some opportunities require sustained focus to realize. Your breadth is power; adding depth makes you unstoppable.",
                power: "When you fully own your intellectual nature, you become the connector — linking ideas and people in ways that create opportunities for everyone.",
                somatic: "You feel expansion in your nervous system and hands — mental excitement, urge to move and communicate.",
                reflection: "Am I learning for growth or avoiding commitment? What would focused curiosity look like?"

                title: "The Nurturing Abundant",
                hook: "Your Jupiter is exalted here — luck flows through your heart. Care creates fortune in ways logic can't explain.",
                core_identity: "Your Jupiter is in Cancer—its exalted sign—blessing you with extraordinary luck through nurturing, emotional intelligence, and creating belonging. Fortune favors you when you care for others.",
                external: "Others experience you as a source of security and belonging. Your nurturing creates environments where everyone thrives — and that thriving returns to you.",
                behavior: "You attract abundance through emotional connection. Business that feels like family, work that nurtures, investments in home and security generate your greatest returns.",
                strength: "Your philosophical outlook is protective and heart-centered. You believe that care creates growth, that security enables expansion, and that emotional bonds are the truest wealth.",
                shadow: "The glitch: clannishness and smothering. You may over-protect, expand your family's interests at others' expense, or use care as control.",
                integration: "Learn that true nurturing includes letting go. Care that creates dependence isn't generous — it's possessive. Support independence.",
