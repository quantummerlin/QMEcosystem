                        <h3>Understanding Your Part of Fortune</h3>
                        <p>The Part of Fortune (⊕) is an ancient Arabic Part that shows where you naturally attract 
                        joy, luck, and fulfillment. It's calculated from your Sun, Moon, and Ascendant, representing 
                        the integration of your spirit (Sun), soul (Moon), and body (Ascendant).</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">When you align with your Part of Fortune, life flows. 
                        Opportunities appear, doors open, and you feel "lucky." This isn't magic - it's alignment 
                        with your true nature. Your fortune grows when you honor this placement.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 2rem; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
                        ${name}, your greatest fortune comes not from forcing, but from flowing with your natural joy in ${fortuneSign}.
