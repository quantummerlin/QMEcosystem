                title: "Month of New Beginnings",
                hook: "The initiator's energy flows through this month, {preferredName}. Personal Month 1 marks a fresh cycle—a time when the universe hands you the pen and says, 'Write something new.' Whatever seeds you plant now carry extraordinary momentum.",
                core_identity: "This month activates your pioneer spirit. You ARE the initiator, the one who starts what others will follow. Your independent energy runs strong—you'll feel called to lead rather than follow, to create rather than consume.",
                external: "Others perceive your heightened confidence this month. You radiate self-assurance that attracts opportunities and supporters. People naturally look to you for direction and decision-making.",
                behavior: "You naturally take charge, make decisive moves, and refuse to wait for permission. Procrastination feels impossible when this energy flows—you want action, results, and forward motion.",
                strength: "Your courage peaks during Month 1. You can start difficult conversations, launch intimidating projects, and take risks that would freeze you in other months. This boldness is real and temporary—use it.",
                shadow: "Impulsiveness may override wisdom. Your strong will might bulldoze others' needs. The drive to go solo may cause you to reject helpful collaboration. Watch for ego disguised as confidence.",
                integration: "Channel your initiative toward projects that benefit beyond yourself. Lead with others rather than over them. Let your courage inspire action rather than intimidate hesitation.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become aggressive, impatient, or tunnel-visioned on your own agenda. You might dismiss input that challenges your direction. Pause before reacting.",
                misread: "Your decisiveness may be seen as stubbornness. Your independence might appear as inability to collaborate. Your confidence could seem like arrogance.",
                relationships: "In relationships, you're more assertive this month. You may initiate important conversations or make bold romantic moves. Partners need to match your energy or give you space to lead.",
                growth: "Learn that strong leadership includes listening. The highest expression of 1 energy isn't just starting things—it's starting the right things with the right people.",
                power: "Trust your instinct to begin. The ideas pressing for expression are real and timely. Take the first step—momentum will follow, {preferredName}.",
                somatic: "Your body feels energized and ready for action. Physical exercise channels this intensity productively. Watch for tension from unreleased drive.",
                reflection: "What have I been waiting to start? Where is fear of failure holding me back? What would I initiate if I knew I couldn't fail?"

            "2": {
                title: "Month of Partnership & Patience",
                hook: "The diplomat's energy embraces you, {preferredName}. Personal Month 2 slows the pace and heightens your sensitivity. This is not a month for charging ahead—it's for noticing nuance, building connection, and allowing rather than forcing.",
                core_identity: "This month activates your cooperative spirit. You ARE the mediator, the one who sees all sides and bridges differences. Your emotional intelligence sharpens—you'll sense undercurrents others miss entirely.",
                external: "Others perceive your gentleness and receptivity this month. You radiate patience that makes people feel safe opening up. Your calm presence soothes environments you enter.",
                behavior: "You naturally seek harmony, avoid conflict, and prioritize relationship over achievement. Aggressive tactics feel wrong—you want everyone to feel included and valued.",
                strength: "Your sensitivity becomes a superpower. You perceive subtleties, read between lines, and know what people need before they ask. This intuition guides you toward aligned connections.",
                shadow: "Indecision may paralyze you as you try to please everyone. Over-sensitivity might take things personally that weren't aimed at you. Avoiding all conflict may enable dysfunction.",
                integration: "Use your diplomatic gifts while maintaining your own position. Balance consideration for others with clarity about your own needs. Not all conflict is harmful—some clears the air.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become passive-aggressive, overly yielding, or emotionally volatile. Your sensitivity absorbs others' tensions. Create space for your own processing.",
                misread: "Your patience may be seen as weakness. Your cooperation might appear as lack of conviction. Your sensitivity could seem like fragility.",
                relationships: "Partnership takes center stage this month. Existing relationships deepen through quality time. New connections form through genuine interest rather than strategic networking.",
                growth: "Learn that true harmony includes your needs, not just others'. The highest expression of 2 energy isn't just peace-keeping—it's creating genuine understanding.",
                power: "Trust the slower pace. What needs to unfold will reveal itself through patience. Your receptivity attracts what forcing would repel, {preferredName}.",
                somatic: "Your body is more sensitive to environment this month. You may need more rest and gentler movement. Honor your nervous system's need for quiet.",
                reflection: "Where am I sacrificing my needs for false harmony? What relationship needs my attention? How can I be cooperative without losing myself?"
            },
            "3": {
                title: "Month of Creative Expression",
                hook: "The artist's energy ignites in you, {preferredName}. Personal Month 3 opens the creative floodgates. Ideas flow, words come easily, and the universe asks you one question: What do you want to express?",
                core_identity: "This month activates your creative spirit. You ARE the communicator, the one whose expression touches others. Your creative channels open wide—inspiration doesn't need to be summoned, it's already flowing.",
                external: "Others perceive your sparkle and charisma this month. You radiate joy that's genuinely contagious. Your enthusiasm lifts the energy of every room you enter.",
                behavior: "You naturally seek creative outlets, social connection, and opportunities to express yourself. Isolation feels wrong—you want to share, connect, and play.",
                strength: "Your communication abilities peak this month. Writing, speaking, presenting, and all forms of expression flow with unusual ease. Use this window for projects requiring your voice.",
                shadow: "Scattered focus may start many things and finish none. Superficiality might keep you from depth. Too much socializing may exhaust rather than energize.",
                integration: "Channel your creative flow toward focused expression rather than dispersing it across too many outlets. Let joy be productive, not just pleasurable.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become scattered, anxious about being liked, or compulsively busy with social activity. Gossip or drama may become tempting.",
                misread: "Your playfulness may be seen as lack of seriousness. Your socializing might appear as avoidance. Your many ideas could seem like inability to commit.",
                relationships: "Social life flourishes this month. You attract new connections and bring fresh energy to existing relationships. Romance carries playful, lighthearted energy.",
                growth: "Learn that creative expression can have depth, not just sparkle. The highest expression of 3 energy isn't just entertainment—it's art that moves people.",
                power: "Trust your creative impulses. What wants to come through you is genuine and valuable. Express boldly—the world needs your unique voice, {preferredName}.",
                somatic: "Your body feels light and energized this month. Movement, dance, and playful exercise suit your mood. Watch for exhaustion from over-socializing.",
                reflection: "What creative project have I been postponing? How can I express myself more authentically? Where am I hiding my light under seriousness?"

            "4": {
                title: "Month of Foundation Building",
                hook: "The builder's energy grounds you, {preferredName}. Personal Month 4 brings you down to earth—literally. This is the month to stop dreaming and start constructing. Foundations built now will support you for years.",
                core_identity: "This month activates your practical spirit. You ARE the builder, the one who turns visions into structures. Your capacity for sustained effort increases—work that would exhaust you in other months feels manageable now.",
                external: "Others perceive your reliability and groundedness this month. You radiate stability that makes people trust your word. Your steadiness creates a sense of safety.",
                behavior: "You naturally seek order, create systems, and tackle practical tasks. You want tangible results—something you can point to and say 'I built that.'",
                strength: "Your discipline and focus peak this month. You can sustain effort that would scatter in other cycles. Use this for projects requiring sustained attention and systematic work.",
                shadow: "Rigidity may close you to better approaches. Overwork might sacrifice health and relationships. Pessimism could see only problems and limitations.",
                integration: "Build with purpose while remaining flexible about methods. Let structure support life rather than constrain it. Include rest as essential, not optional.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become controlling, inflexible, or overwhelmed by details. You might work through exhaustion rather than rest. Create non-negotiable recovery time.",
                misread: "Your seriousness may be seen as joylessness. Your attention to detail might appear as perfectionism. Your practicality could seem like lack of vision.",
                relationships: "Relationships benefit from practical attention this month. Show care through actions—organizing, building, providing. Quality time means working together toward shared goals.",
                growth: "Learn that solid foundations can support creative expression. The highest expression of 4 energy isn't just duty—it's building something meaningful that lasts.",
                power: "Trust your ability to manifest. What you construct now creates lasting security. Your effort IS producing results, even when progress seems slow, {preferredName}.",
                somatic: "Your body craves routine and consistency this month. Regular exercise, sleep schedules, and nutrition matter more now. Your physical foundation supports everything else.",
                reflection: "What foundation have I been neglecting? Where does my life need more structure? What would 'building with purpose' look like for me?"

                core_identity: "This month activates your freedom-seeker. You ARE the adventurer, the one who refuses to be caged by routine. Your tolerance for sameness drops dramatically—you need variety, movement, and new experiences.",
