                        you approach one-on-one relationships. It's opposite your Rising sign (Ascendant), which 
                        represents how you present yourself to the world.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">You're naturally ${reading.yourRising} Rising (the way you appear), 
                        so you seek ${descendantSign} qualities in partners - the qualities that balance and complete you.</p>

                        For your true Descendant, get a full birth chart with accurate birth time.</em></p>
