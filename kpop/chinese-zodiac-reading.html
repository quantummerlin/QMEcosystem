                <p>The Chinese Zodiac follows a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by an animal. Combined with the five elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) rotating every 2 years, this creates a 60-year cycle of unique combinations that shape your personality, strengths, and life path.</p>

                core_identity: "You ARE the quick mind, the resourceful navigator, the one who finds pathways invisible to others. Your intelligence isn't merely academic—it's street-smart, intuitive, practical. You assess situations rapidly, finding solutions where others see only walls.",
                external: "Others perceive you as clever, charming, and socially adept. You navigate conversations with wit, remembering details about people that make them feel actually seen. Your warmth draws people in while your sharpness earns respect.",
                behavior: "You naturally seek advantage, opportunity, and strategic positioning. Social situations become chess games you play naturally. You build networks, gather resources, and create security through intelligence rather than force.",

                external: "Others perceive you as reliable, trustworthy, and solid. People know they can count on your word. You're the foundation others build upon, the rock in chaos. Your quiet strength commands respect without demanding attention.",
                behavior: "You naturally create systems, establish routines, and work methodically toward long-term objectives. You prefer proven methods over experiments. Your approach is thorough rather than flashy—substance over style.",
                strength: "Your stamina and determination are INSANE. You can sustain effort that exhausts others. Hard work doesn't deplete you—it's your natural expression. You build things meant to last.",
