                emoji: "🐀",
                traits: "Quick-witted, resourceful, versatile, kind",
                reading: `{preferredName}, you were born in the Year of the Rat — the first sign of the Chinese Zodiac, symbolizing new beginnings, intelligence, and adaptability.

**Your Natural Gifts**

Rats are incredibly quick-witted and resourceful. You have a sharp mind that can assess situations rapidly and find creative solutions where others see only obstacles. Your intelligence isn't just academic—it's practical, street-smart, and deeply intuitive.

You're naturally charming and sociable, able to make friends easily and navigate social situations with grace. People are drawn to your wit, humor, and genuine interest in them. You remember details about people that others forget, making them feel seen and valued.

**Your Inner Drive**

Deep down, security matters immensely to you. You work hard to build stability—financially, emotionally, and in relationships. You're not greedy, but you do appreciate having a safety net. This makes you an excellent saver and planner.

You're adaptable and versatile, able to thrive in various environments. When circumstances change, you pivot quickly rather than resisting. This flexibility is one of your greatest strengths in an unpredictable world.

**Your Challenges**

Sometimes your quick mind can lead to overthinking or worry. You might see problems before they exist, creating unnecessary stress. Learning to trust that things will work out is an ongoing lesson.

You can be a bit opportunistic, always looking for the next advantage. While this serves you well professionally, make sure you're not cutting corners ethically or taking shortcuts that could harm relationships.

**In Love & Relationships**

In love, you're passionate and devoted once you commit. You show affection through thoughtful gestures and remembering what matters to your partner. You need someone who appreciates your intelligence and can match your mental agility.

You're protective of those you love, sometimes to the point of being a bit controlling. You want to help and guide, but remember to let others make their own choices and mistakes.

**Career & Life Path**

You excel in careers requiring quick thinking, adaptability, and people skills. Sales, entrepreneurship, writing, design, and anything involving strategy or problem-solving suits you well.

You're meant to be a pioneer in your own way—starting things, initiating projects, seeing opportunities others miss. Trust your instincts and don't be afraid to take calculated risks.`

                emoji: "🐂",
                traits: "Diligent, dependable, strong, determined",
                reading: `{preferredName}, you were born in the Year of the Ox — a symbol of strength, reliability, and unwavering determination.

**Your Natural Gifts**

You possess incredible perseverance and stamina. When you commit to something, you see it through no matter how long it takes. Others may sprint, but you're the marathon runner who ultimately crosses the finish line.

Your reliability is legendary. People know they can count on you to deliver on your promises, show up on time, and do quality work. This trustworthiness makes you invaluable in any team or relationship.

You have a methodical, organized approach to life. You prefer systems, routines, and step-by-step plans. While others chase shiny objects, you're building something solid and lasting.

**Your Inner Drive**

You value stability, tradition, and proven methods. You're not interested in reinventing the wheel—you'd rather perfect what already works. This makes you an excellent preserver of knowledge and keeper of standards.

Hard work doesn't scare you; in fact, you take pride in it. You believe in earning what you have through honest effort. Quick fixes and shortcuts don't appeal to you—you want to build something real.

**Your Challenges**

Your stubbornness can sometimes work against you. Once you've made up your mind, you resist changing course even when new information suggests you should. Learning to be flexible without sacrificing your values is key.

You can be overly serious and forget to have fun. You're so focused on responsibilities and goals that you might miss out on spontaneous joy. Remember that rest and play are productive too.

**In Love & Relationships**

In relationships, you're loyal to a fault. Once you commit, you're in for life. You show love through actions more than words—providing, protecting, and creating stability for those you care about.

You need a partner who appreciates your steady nature and doesn't try to rush you or make you into something you're not. You thrive with someone who values depth over excitement.

**Career & Life Path**

You excel in careers requiring patience, precision, and long-term thinking. Agriculture, construction, finance, education, and any field where quality and consistency matter suit you perfectly.

Your life purpose involves building something lasting—whether that's a business, a family legacy, strong relationships, or tangible contributions to your community. You're here to show the power of sustained effort.`

                traits: "Brave, confident, competitive, charismatic",
                reading: `{preferredName}, you were born in the Year of the Tiger — embodying courage, passion, and natural leadership.

**Your Natural Gifts**

You radiate confidence and charisma. When you enter a room, people notice. There's a magnetic quality to your presence that draws others to you. You're a natural leader who inspires through example and enthusiasm.

Your bravery is remarkable. You're willing to take risks others fear, stand up for what's right, and face challenges head-on. This courage isn't recklessness—it comes from deep self-trust and belief in your abilities.

You have intense passion for whatever captures your interest. When you commit to something, you go all in with full energy and focus. This intensity makes you capable of extraordinary achievements.

**Your Inner Drive**

Freedom and independence are sacred to you. You resist being controlled, managed, or told what to do. You need space to roam, explore, and make your own choices. You'd rather fail on your own terms than succeed following someone else's plan.

Competition energizes you. You love a good challenge and thrive when you have something to conquer or prove. This competitive spirit pushes you to excel and refuse mediocrity.

**Your Challenges**

Your intensity can be overwhelming for others. You operate at such high energy that calmer people might feel steamrolled. Learning to modulate your approach based on the situation serves you well.

Impulsiveness can get you into trouble. You act quickly on gut feelings, which sometimes works brilliantly and sometimes leads to preventable mistakes. Pausing to consider consequences—just briefly—can save you unnecessary drama.

**In Love & Relationships**

You're passionate and romantic, bringing exciting energy to relationships. You love deeply and express it openly. Your partner needs to be secure enough to handle your strong personality without trying to tame you.

You need a relationship that allows independence and doesn't feel restrictive. Too many rules or expectations make you feel trapped. You thrive with someone who's confident enough to be your equal.

Perfectionism drives you. You set incredibly high standards for yourself and often for others. You don't do things halfway—it's excellence or nothing. This pursuit of greatness propels you forward.

Freedom is your oxygen. You need space to roam, explore, and make your own choices without restriction. Any situation that feels confining or limiting triggers your flight response.

Adventure calls to you. You're meant to experience life fully—travel, try new things, meet diverse people, and collect stories. Staying in one place too long or doing the same thing repeatedly feels like death.

**Your Challenges**

Your need for freedom can make commitment difficult. Whether in relationships or careers, you resist feeling trapped. Learning that commitment to the right things actually expands rather than limits you is key.

Restlessness can prevent you from seeing things through. You start projects with tremendous enthusiasm, but when the initial excitement fades, you're already onto the next thing. Developing follow-through serves your long-term success.

Beauty and harmony are essential to your wellbeing. You need to live and work in environments that are aesthetically pleasing and emotionally peaceful. Harsh, ugly, or conflict-filled spaces drain your energy.

Creative expression isn't optional for you—it's how you process life and maintain balance. When you can't create, you feel lost. Your art, in whatever form, is your way of making sense of the world.

**Your Challenges**

Your sensitivity can make you vulnerable to being overwhelmed by harsh realities. You might escape into fantasy or avoid confronting difficult truths. Building emotional resilience while maintaining your soft heart is important.
