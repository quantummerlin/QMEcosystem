Past lives in Libra (your South Node) made you a master of compromise, partnership, and keeping the peace—but this lifetime demands you find your own voice. Your soul evolution requires moving from 'we' consciousness to healthy 'I' consciousness. You're learning that sometimes the most loving thing you can do is fight for yourself.",
                external: "Others may experience you as learning to assert yourself, sometimes awkwardly—like a person finding their voice after years of silence. Your debut destiny energy appears as emerging independence, growing courage, fresh starts.",

Past lives in Scorpio (your South Node) made you a master of crisis, transformation, and intensity—but this lifetime demands you embrace peace. Your soul evolution requires moving from drama to calm, from crisis to stability, from intensity to appreciation of life's simple gifts.",

Past lives in Sagittarius (your South Node) made you a teacher, preacher, or philosopher—but this lifetime demands you become a student again. Your soul evolution requires moving from knowing to inquiring, from preaching to listening, from truth-having to truth-seeking.",
