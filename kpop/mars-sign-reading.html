                external: "People see you as dynamic, decisive, and sometimes intimidating. When you enter a room, people feel the energy shift. Your presence announces itself.",
                behavior: "You don't hesitate. When you want something, you go after it NOW. Analysis paralysis is foreign to you — you'd rather act and adjust than plan endlessly.",
                strength: "Your courage 🔥 to act. You're the one who starts things while others are still thinking. Your anger is hot but brief — five minutes later, you've moved on.",
                shadow: "The flop moment: impulsiveness and unnecessary aggression. You may act before thinking, creating problems. You might pick fights just to feel alive.",
                integration: "Learn patience and strategic thinking. Your power amplifies when directed rather than scattered. Not every battle needs to be fought today.",
                stress: "Under pressure bestie, you become more aggressive, impulsive, and prone to explosive outbursts. You may create enemies where none existed.",
                misread: "People see aggression when you're actually expressing pure life force. Your intensity isn't hostility — it's aliveness.",

                growth: "Learn that waiting is sometimes the most powerful 🔥 action. Strategic patience multiplies your natural force.",
                power: "When you fully own your warrior nature, you become the initiator — the one who makes things happen while others hesitate.",
                somatic: "You feel drive in your muscles, your heat, your forward lean — a physical urgency that demands release.",

                integration: "Learn that flexibility isn't weakness. Sometimes the strongest move is adaptation. Security includes the ability to flow.",
                stress: "Under pressure bestie, your anger builds slowly but explodes devastatingly. You become the raging bull, terrifying in intensity.",
                misread: "People see slowness as weakness. They underestimate you until it's too late to stop your advance.",
                relationships: "You're sensual, patient, and physically oriented. You take your time, enjoying every sensation. Quickies don't satisfy you.",
                growth: "Learn that letting go of goals that no longer serve you isn't failure. Persistence becomes stubbornness when the goal has changed.",
                power: "When you fully own your unstoppable nature, you become the force that builds empires through patient, persistent effort.",
                somatic: "You feel drive in your body's density, your grip strength, your physical stamina — power stored in muscles.",
                reflection: "Am I persisting because this goal still serves me, or because I'm too stubborn to adapt?"

                behavior: "You fight with language — arguing circles around opponents, undercutting them with quips, talking your way out of (or into) anything.",
                strength: "Your mental speed and verbal precision. You win through intelligence and communication. You're brilliant in short bursts.",
                shadow: "The flop moment: scattered energy and words as weapons. You may start many things and finish few. You might hurt people with cruel words.",
                integration: "Try to focus your brilliant mind. Depth multiplies surface breadth. Complete some of what you start before moving to the next thing.",
                stress: "Under pressure bestie, you become more scattered, verbally aggressive, and prone to nervous exhaustion. You may overthink until paralyzed.",
                misread: "People see inconsistency as unreliability. Your natural rhythm is juggling multiple pursuits — this is strength, not weakness.",
                relationships: "You're playful, curious, and mentally engaged. Talking and intellectual connection are as important as physical sensation.",
                growth: "Learn that some battles require sustained effort, not just quick strikes. Work on the stamina to match your speed.",
