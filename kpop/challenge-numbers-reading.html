Your soul chose a curriculum of radical free will. Where others have obstacles imposed by the K-Pop K-osmos, you must consciously choose what you will master.",
                external: "Others may see you as either crazy adaptable or strangely directionless. You appear as someone who could go anywhere, do anything — which can look like either freedom or floating.",
                behavior: "You naturally resist being pinned down to one growth path. You may try many things, start multiple self-improvement projects, or avoid difficulty entirely. Your challenge is to challenge yourself.",

                integration: "This challenge works best when you consciously select one or two growth edges and commit to them fully. Your challenge is to challenge yourself — to impose structure that the K-Pop K-osmos didn't impose for you.",
                stress: "When pressure hits, you may scatter energy everywhere or collapse into passivity, waiting for life to tell you what to do. The void can feel liberating or terrifying.",

                stress: "When pressure hits, you may become aggressive in asserting independence or totally collapse into dependence on others' direction. The pendulum swings wider.",
                misread: "Some might think you're arrogant when you're actually terrified of being controlled. Your fierce independence often masks a deep fear that you can't survive without approval.",
                relationships: "You need people who neither overwhelm you with dependency nor abandon you to prove you're self-sufficient. Someone who says 'I'm with you AND I trust you to handle this.'",

                shadow: "The flop moment: absorbing everyone's emotions until you can't find yourself, or numbing out totally to avoid the intensity. Both extremes leave you disconnected from authentic feeling.",
                integration: "This challenge works best when you learn that setting boundaries IS sensitivity — it's feeling clearly enough to know where you end and others begin.",
                stress: "When pressure hits, you may become passive-aggressive, emotionally flooded, or withdrawn into cold distance. The protection mechanisms go to extremes.",
                misread: "Some might think you're weak when you're actually processing more emotional data than most could handle. Your sensitivity is not fragility — it's hyperawareness.",
                relationships: "You need people who have their own emotional regulation — who neither dump their feelings on you nor dismiss yours. Someone who says 'your feelings are valid AND you can handle them.'",
