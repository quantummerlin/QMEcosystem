                        shaping your childhood experiences. The main challenge becomes dominant in your mature years. 
                        The final challenge stays with you for life, becoming your ultimate mastery.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Each time you face and work through a challenge, you gain strength. 
                        These difficulties are literally making you who you're meant to become.</p>

                        Your challenges are perfectly designed for your growth. You wouldn't have them if you 
                        weren't capable of mastering them.</p>
