                behavior: "You fall fast and hard. Patience in courtship feels like torture. You prefer direct declarations over subtle hints. You'd rather know immediately if someone is interested than play guessing games.",
                strength: "Your courage 🔥 in love. You go after what you want without apology. Your passion is legendary, and your willingness to initiate creates opportunities others miss.",
                shadow: "The flop moment: impatience and selfishness. You may pursue your own desires without considering your partner's needs. You might grow bored once the chase is over.",
                integration: "Try to sustain passion beyond the initial conquest. Love requires patience, not just pursuit. The relationship IS the adventure, not just winning the prize.",

                misread: "Some might think you're selfish or commitment-phobic when you're actually deeply passionate — just wired for action rather than waiting.",
                relationships: "You need excitement and independence. You're attracted to confident, strong-willed people who can match your energy. Pushovers bore you instantly.",
                growth: "Learn that vulnerability is as brave as pursuit. Sometimes the bravest thing is staying, not chasing. Depth develops after the chase ends.",

                relationships: "You need touch, quality, and reliability. Physical affection is essential. You express love through providing material comfort and sensory pleasure.",
                growth: "Learn that love isn't a possession. The tighter you grip, the more it slips away. Security is an internal state, not an external guarantee.",
                power: "When you fully own your sensual nature, you become the anchor — showing others what sustained, embodied love looks like.",

                integration: "Learn that depth and lightness can coexist. You don't have to choose between interesting and intimate. The mind can serve the heart.",
                stress: "Under pressure bestie, you become more scattered, flirtatious, or verbally defensive. You may use wit to deflect from vulnerable conversations.",
                misread: "Some might think you're emotionally shallow when you're actually processing love intellectually first — a valid path to deeper connection.",
                relationships: "You need mental stimulation. Boring, predictable partners lose your interest quickly. Your love language is words — verbal affirmation and constant communication.",
