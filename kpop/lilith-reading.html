                        <h3>Understanding Lilith</h3>
                        <p>Black Moon Lilith represents the part of you that has been shamed, repressed, and cast into shadow. 
                        In mythology, Lilith was Adam's first wife who refused to submit and was demonized for it. 
                        Your Lilith shows where you've been told to be less, where you've been shamed for your power, 
                        and where you must reclaim your wild, untamed nature.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is not about becoming your worst self - it's about integrating 
                        what you've repressed. The goal is to own your shadow consciously rather than acting it out unconsciously.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 2rem; text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #8b008b;">
                        ${name}, your Lilith is not your enemy - she's the part of you that refuses to be tamed. 
                        Integration, not suppression, is the path to wholeness.
                    </p>
