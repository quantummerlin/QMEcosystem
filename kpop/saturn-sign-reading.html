                core_identity: "Your Saturn is in Aries, placing your karmic lessons around courage, independence, and self-assertion. You're learning to stand up for yourself, act decisively, and trust your own leadership.",
                external: "Others may see you as reluctant to take charge or overly aggressive when pushed. Your relationship with assertion is still developing — inconsistent until mastered.",
                behavior: "Your core challenge: Fear of asserting yourself. Early experiences may have taught you that being bold, angry, or self-focused was dangerous or wrong.",
                strength: "When you act despite fear, lead when called, and trust your instincts, Saturn rewards you with genuine authority. Your earned courage becomes unshakeable.",
                shadow: "The glitch: Fear of conflict, aggression, or being seen as selfish. You may avoid confrontation excessively or swing to overcompensation—becoming aggressive to mask insecurity.",
                integration: "True courage isn't recklessness—it's facing fear consciously. You're learning that healthy self-assertion serves everyone, that your anger has wisdom.",
                stress: "Under pressure, your fear of conflict may intensify, causing either complete avoidance or explosive reaction. Neither serves you.",
                misread: "People see either hesitation or aggression. What they don't see is your deep work with courage — you're learning what most people never question.",
                relationships: "You're learning to assert your needs in partnership without guilt. Relationships are laboratories for practicing healthy self-expression.",
                growth: "Learn that saying 'I want' and 'I need' isn't selfish — it's essential. Your Saturn Return demands independent action and claimed autonomy.",
                power: "Once you integrate this lesson, you become a model of true courage—not reactive aggression but conscious, mature assertion that inspires others.",
                somatic: "You feel Saturn's lessons in your muscles and jaw — tension around action, physical holding back, or explosive release.",

                external: "Others may see you as anxious about money or overly focused on stability. Your relationship with resources is still developing — complicated until mastered.",
                behavior: "Your core challenge: Fear of scarcity and worthlessness. You may have experienced early material instability or messages that your value depended on what you had.",
                strength: "When you build genuine security through patient effort and develop self-worth independent of possessions, Saturn rewards you with unshakeable stability.",
                shadow: "The glitch: Fear of poverty, loss, or being worthless. You may hoard resources anxiously or swing to rejecting material needs entirely as 'unspiritual.'",
                integration: "True security is internal. You're learning that patient, honest effort creates lasting stability, that your worth is inherent, and that resources are tools.",
                stress: "Under pressure, scarcity fear intensifies. You may grip tighter to what you have or feel your worthlessness more acutely.",
                misread: "People see materialism or financial anxiety. What they don't see is your deep work with worth — you're learning what money can and cannot provide.",
                relationships: "You're learning that love isn't about what you provide materially. Your worth to partners is inherent, not earned through resources.",
                growth: "Learn to separate self-worth from net worth. Your Saturn Return demands you build real stability through patient effort.",
                power: "Once you integrate this lesson, you become a rock of genuine stability—someone whose security comes from within, who builds patiently.",
                somatic: "You feel Saturn's lessons in your body's tension around resources — physical gripping, throat tightness around worth.",

                external: "Others may see you as quiet or uncertain in speech, or overcompensating with nervous chatter. Your relationship with communication is still developing.",
                behavior: "Your core challenge: Fear of being stupid, misunderstood, or mentally inadequate. Early experiences may have taught you that your words were wrong or your thoughts didn't matter.",
                strength: "When you develop mental discipline, communicate with precision, and commit to learning despite insecurity, Saturn rewards you with earned intellectual authority.",
                shadow: "The glitch: Fear of speaking up, being wrong, or intellectual inadequacy. You may stay silent to avoid criticism or talk excessively without substance.",
                integration: "True intelligence is developed, not inherited. You're learning that clear thinking requires discipline and that words have weight and consequences.",
                stress: "Under pressure, your fear of being wrong or stupid intensifies. You may go silent or become scattered and incoherent.",
                misread: "People see hesitancy or intellectualizing. What they don't see is your deep work with communication — you're learning to trust your mind.",
                relationships: "You're learning to communicate clearly in partnership. Saying what you mean, meaning what you say — this is your relational work.",
                growth: "Learn that your thoughts deserve expression. Your Saturn Return demands you develop your mind seriously and speak with authority.",
