You know how to survive alone, make quick decisions, and charge into battle. This mastery is your foundation—but if you stay here, you miss your soul's growth. Your North Node in Libra calls you toward partnership, diplomacy, and finding yourself through conscious relating.",

Your North Node in Scorpio calls you toward transform ✨ation, depth, and discovering that true security is internal.",
