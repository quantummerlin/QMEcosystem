The death/rebirth pattern: Repeated cycles of relationship death—partnerships ending so that new, more evolved ones can begin.

Your power paradox: Your greatest power—relational transformation—requires balance between self and other that doesn't sacrifice either.

Your Pluto work: Learning that true partnership transforms both partners without consuming either.`,

            "Scorpio": `{preferredName}, your Pluto is in Scorpio—its home sign—(approximately 1984-1995), marking you as part of a generation with intensified transformative power, depth, and capacity for profound rebirth.

Your generation's transformation theme: The death and rebirth of death itself. Your cohort transforms by going deeper than any generation before, confronting the absolute darkness, and emerging with genuine phoenix power.

Your core power: Extraordinary transformative ability, capacity to face any shadow, power to die and be reborn repeatedly throughout life.

Where you experience intensity: Everywhere. You experience life more intensely than other generations, with heightened awareness of death, sexuality, power, and the hidden.

Your shadow work: Confronting the darkest shadows—obsession, manipulation, the desire to control through psychological insight, and the seductive power of darkness itself.

Your transformation triggers: Crises are your natural habitat. You transform through intensity, through facing what others can't, through going where light doesn't easily reach.

Your generation's gift: The ability to transform absolutely, to face any shadow, to guide others through their darkest nights.

The death/rebirth pattern: Intense and frequent. You die and are reborn more times in one lifetime than others do in several.

Your power paradox: Your greatest power—absolute transformation—can either heal the world or destroy yourself. Boundaries with darkness are essential.

Your Pluto work: Learning to carry transformative power without being consumed by it.`,

            "Sagittarius": `{preferredName}, your Pluto is in Sagittarius (approximately 1995-2008), marking you as part of a generation that transforms through revolutionary changes in belief, meaning, and global connection.

Your generation's transformation theme: The death and rebirth of meaning and belief. Your cohort transforms by destroying false beliefs and rebuilding genuine faith.

Your core power: The power to transform through truth-seeking, to destroy ideologies that no longer serve, to find meaning in a world where old meanings have died.

Where you experience intensity: In matters of belief, truth, and meaning. Power struggles around ideology, religion, and what's true mark your life.

Your shadow work: Confronting fanaticism, the shadow of belief—using truth as a weapon, self-righteous destruction, and the dark side of crusading.

Your transformation triggers: Crises of meaning, encounters with beliefs that shatter worldview, experiences that demand genuine faith be found or forged.

Your generation's gift: The ability to transform belief systems, to find authentic meaning after the death of false beliefs, to teach truth that liberates.

The death/rebirth pattern: Repeated cycles of worldview death—beliefs you were certain of destroyed, making space for truer understanding.

Your power paradox: Your greatest power—transforming belief—can either liberate through truth or destroy through fanaticism.

Your Pluto work: Learning that truth transforms only when delivered with wisdom and compassion.`,

            "Capricorn": `{preferredName}, your Pluto is in Capricorn (approximately 2008-2024), marking you as part of a generation that transforms through revolutionary changes in authority, institutions, and power structures.

Your core power: The power to transform systems, to destroy dysfunctional institutions, to rebuild authority on authentic foundations.

Where you experience intensity: In matters of authority, achievement, and structure. Power struggles around legitimate authority mark your life.

Your shadow work: Confronting the shadow of power—authoritarianism, using structure for control, becoming the very oppressive force you sought to destroy.

Your transformation triggers: Crises involving authority figures, institutional collapse, and the failure of structures you depended on.

Your generation's gift: The ability to transform power structures, to build institutions that serve rather than oppress, to earn authority through integrity.

The death/rebirth pattern: Repeated cycles of authority death—watching respected figures or institutions fall, having to rebuild trust in structure.

Your power paradox: Your greatest power—structural transformation—can either build better systems or become tyrannical in the effort.

Your Pluto work: Learning that true authority serves rather than dominates.`,

            "Aquarius": `{preferredName}, your Pluto is in Aquarius (approximately 2024-2044), marking you as part of a generation that transforms through revolutionary changes in technology, community, and human evolution.

Your generation's transformation theme: The death and rebirth of humanity itself. Your cohort transforms through technological revolution, new forms of human connection, and redefining what it means to be human.

Your transformation triggers: Crises involving technology, collective movements, and moments where human evolution hangs in the balance.

Your generation's gift: The ability to transform human possibility, to use technology for liberation, to create genuine community.

The death/rebirth pattern: Repeated cycles of collective death—old forms of society dying, new ones being born through your generation's efforts.

Your power paradox: Your greatest power—technological transformation—can either evolve humanity or enslave it.

Your Pluto work: Learning to wield transformative technology in service of human liberation.`,

            "Pisces": `{preferredName}, your Pluto is in Pisces (approximately 2044-2068), marking you as part of a generation that transforms through spiritual revolution and the dissolution of boundaries.

Where you experience intensity: In spiritual matters, collective suffering, and the dissolution of boundaries. Power struggles around spiritual truth mark your life.

Your shadow work: Confronting the shadow of spirituality—escapism, martyrdom, using transcendence to avoid reality, and the seduction of dissolution.

Your transformation triggers: Crises involving spiritual awakening, collective suffering that demands response, and moments requiring surrender.

Your generation's gift: The ability to transform through spiritual awakening, to heal collective trauma, to dissolve barriers that separate humanity.

The death/rebirth pattern: Repeated cycles of ego death—dissolution of self boundaries, experiences of oceanic unity, and the challenge of rebuilding self afterward.

Your power paradox: Your greatest power—spiritual transformation—can either awaken or enable escape from necessary growth.

Your Pluto work: Learning that true transcendence includes rather than escapes reality.`
