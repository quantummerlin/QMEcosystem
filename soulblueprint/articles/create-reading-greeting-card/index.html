        <!-- Hook -->
        <p>Store-bought cards say "Happy Birthday" in someone else's words. Personalized cards say <em>"I see who you are, and I think it's incredible"</em> — in YOUR words, powered by THEIR reading. <strong>That's the difference between a card that gets recycled and one that gets kept forever.</strong></p>

        <p>A Soul Blueprint reading contains perfect card-worthy material — short affirmations, key strengths, cosmic identity data, and personality insights that feel almost poetic. With 20 minutes and free tools, you can turn that data into a beautifully designed greeting card.</p>

        <p><strong>This guide covers everything</strong> — from extracting the right content from a <a href="/soulblueprint/">Soul Blueprint reading</a>, to writing the perfect message with AI, to designing and printing a fold card at home.</p>

                <div class="tutorial-step-body">
                    <p>A card has limited space, so you need the most impactful content. Generate the person's reading at the <a href="/soulblueprint/">Soul Blueprint generator</a> and look for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A short, punchy quote or affirmation</strong> — something that captures their essence in one sentence</li>
                        <li><strong>Their top 2–3 key traits</strong> — single words that define them (e.g., "Visionary · Resilient · Magnetic")</li>
                        <li><strong>Their Sun sign and symbol</strong> — a recognizable cosmic identity marker</li>
                        <li><strong>A "cosmic message"</strong> — a line from the reading that feels like it was written just for them</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Keep it to <strong>under 30 words</strong> for the card front, and <strong>50–80 words</strong> for the inside message. Cards are intimate — every word should earn its place.</p>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <strong>💡 The best card content feels like a secret</strong>
                        The most powerful card messages use insights that feel personal and specific — not generic. "You're amazing!" is generic. "Your Moon in Pisces gives you a depth of empathy that most people never develop — and the world is better because you feel things so deeply" is personal. That's the difference.

<pre>I'm creating a personalized greeting card for someone based on their personality reading. Write two versions of the card content:

**CARD FRONT (under 20 words):**
- A short, beautiful statement about who they are
- Could be a quote, affirmation, or poetic one-liner
- Should feel cosmic and personal, not generic

**CARD INSIDE (50–80 words):**
- A heartfelt birthday/occasion message that references their specific traits, strengths, and cosmic identity
- Mention 1–2 specific things from the reading (e.g., their element, a key strength, their life path)
- Warm, genuine tone — like a close friend who really sees them
- End with something forward-looking and empowering

Write 3 options for each so I can pick my favourite.

Here is their reading:

                <div class="tutorial-step-body">
                    <p>Open <a href="https://canva.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva</a> and search for <strong>"greeting card"</strong> or <strong>"birthday card"</strong> templates. Pick a design that matches the person's vibe:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Minimalist typography cards</strong> — perfect for Earth and Air signs who appreciate clean design</li>
                        <li><strong>Celestial/starry designs</strong> — great for Water signs and anyone who loves the cosmic aesthetic</li>
                        <li><strong>Bold, colourful cards</strong> — ideal for Fire signs who want energy and warmth</li>
                        <li><strong>Floral or nature cards</strong> — beautiful for Earth-dominant readings</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Canva card templates are typically <strong>5 × 7 inches</strong> (fold card format) with a front and inside page. Replace the template text with your AI-generated content. Keep the front dramatic and the inside personal.</p>
                    <p><strong>Design tips:</strong> Use no more than 2 fonts. Match the colour palette to their element — warm golds for Fire, forest greens for Earth, sky blues for Air, deep teals for Water. Add their zodiac symbol as a small decorative element.</p>
                </div>

                    <div class="step-badge"></div>
                    <h3>Print and Fold at Home</h3>
                    <button class="step-toggle" aria-label="Toggle step">▼</button>
                </div>
                <div class="tutorial-step-body">
                    <p>Download your card from Canva as <strong>PDF Print</strong> for best quality. Then print:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Paper:</strong> Use heavy card stock (200–300 gsm). Standard copy paper is too flimsy for a card. Card stock is available at any office supply store or Amazon for about $8–12 per pack.</li>
                        <li><strong>Printing:</strong> Print double-sided if your printer supports it. If not, print the front and inside separately, then glue back-to-back before folding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Folding:</strong> Score the fold line first using a ruler and a bone folder (or the back of a butter knife). This creates a crisp, clean fold instead of a cracked crease.</li>
                        <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> Trim any white edges with a paper cutter or sharp scissors. Slide the card into an envelope — A7 envelopes (5.25 × 7.25 in) fit standard 5 × 7 cards.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>⚠️ Test print on regular paper first</strong>
                        Before using your nice card stock, do a test print on regular paper. Check that the front and inside align properly when folded, text isn't cut off, and colours look right. Card stock is too expensive to waste on test prints.

                        <li><strong>Image card:</strong> Download from Canva as a high-res PNG and text or email it directly. Simple and immediate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Animated card:</strong> Use Canva's animation features to add subtle movement — floating stars, gentle gradient shifts, or text reveal effects. Download as an MP4 and send via messaging apps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interactive card:</strong> Use a free platform like <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva Websites</a> to create a one-page web card with a shareable link. The recipient clicks the link and sees a beautiful full-screen card.</li>
                        <li><strong>E-card services:</strong> Upload your Canva design to Paperless Post or Greenvelope for a polished digital delivery experience with RSVP tracking.</li>

<pre>Write a short digital birthday card message (under 100 words) for someone based on their personality reading. The tone should be:
- Warm and celebratory
- Reference 1–2 specific traits from their reading
- Include an emoji or two that match their element (🔥 Fire, 🌿 Earth, 💨 Air, 🌊 Water)
- End with a bold one-line affirmation about the year ahead

Keep it text-message friendly — no formal greeting card language.

        <!-- Common Mistakes -->
        <h2 id="mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Writing too much inside the card.</strong> A card message should be 50–80 words, not 200. If you have more to say, write a separate letter and tuck it inside the card.</li>
            <li><strong>Using generic astrology language.</strong> "You're such a Scorpio" is lazy. "Your Scorpio intensity is exactly why people trust you with their deepest secrets" is personal. Always ground the message in specific reading insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Printing on thin paper.</strong> Anything under 200 gsm will feel flimsy and cheap. Card stock is non-negotiable for a physical card.</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetting the envelope.</strong> A beautiful card deserves a proper envelope. A7 envelopes are standard and cost pennies. Don't hand someone a bare card.</li>
            <li><strong>Overdesigning the card.</strong> The message is the star — the design should frame it, not compete with it. Keep visuals simple and let the words do the emotional heavy lifting.</li>
        </ol>
