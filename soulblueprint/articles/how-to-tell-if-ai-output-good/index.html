        <div class="container-narrow">
            <p class="article-hook">AI always sounds confident. That's the problem. Whether it's giving you life-changing advice or making something up entirely, the tone is exactly the same. This guide teaches you how to tell the difference.</p>

            <div class="ad-zone"><span class="ad-zone-label">Advertisement</span></div>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>AI doesn't know when it's wrong. It has no internal "confidence meter". A completely fabricated fact and a verified truth are delivered with the same polished certainty.</p>
            <p>This means the quality filter has to be <strong>you</strong>. The good news: it's not hard once you know what to look for.</p>

            <h2>The 7-Point Quality Checklist</h2>
            <p>Run every important AI response through these 7 checks. It takes 60 seconds and saves you from bad decisions.</p>

            <h3>✅ 1. Is it specific — or vague?</h3>
            <p><strong>Bad sign:</strong> The response is full of generalities that could apply to anyone.</p>
            <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> It includes specific details, numbers, examples, or names relevant to YOUR question.</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">
                <div class="compare-bad">
                    <h4>❌ Vague (low quality)</h4>
                    <p><em>"You should focus on improving your communication skills and being more organised."</em></p>
                    <p class="compare-note">Generic advice. Could be said to literally anyone.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="compare-good">
                    <h4>✅ Specific (high quality)</h4>
                    <p><em>"With your Gemini Sun's natural verbal agility but Virgo Moon's tendency to over-analyse before speaking, try the '3-second rule' — pause for 3 seconds before responding in heated conversations."</em></p>
                    <p class="compare-note">Tailored to the actual input. Gives an actionable technique.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>✅ 2. Can you verify the facts?</h3>
            <p><strong>Bad sign:</strong> It mentions specific statistics, dates, or quotes that you can't find with a quick Google search.</p>
            <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Factual claims check out, or the AI explicitly says "this is my interpretation" when being subjective.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>💡 Quick verification trick:</strong> Copy any specific claim from an AI response, paste it into Google with quotes, and see if real sources confirm it. Takes 10 seconds.
            </div>

            <h3>✅ 3. Is it well-structured?</h3>
            <p><strong>Bad sign:</strong> One giant wall of text with no organisation.</p>
            <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Clear headings, bullet points, numbered steps, or logical flow from intro → details → summary.</p>
            <p>Note: If your output is a wall of text, that might be YOUR fault — you probably didn't specify a format in your prompt. <a href="../how-to-write-good-ai-prompt/">Learn the R-T-C-F formula →</a></p>

            <h3>✅ 4. Does it actually answer YOUR question?</h3>
            <p><strong>Bad sign:</strong> The AI gives a thorough but generic answer about the topic, ignoring the specific angle you asked about.</p>
            <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> The response directly addresses your exact question, with your specific context woven throughout.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>⚠️ Common trap:</strong> AI loves to give you "everything it knows about the topic" instead of just answering your question. If you asked about your Leo Sun's career strengths and got a general essay about Leo personality, the output isn't good enough — ask it to be more specific.
            </div>

            <div class="ad-zone"><span class="ad-zone-label">Advertisement</span></div>

            <h3>✅ 5. Does the tone match what you asked for?</h3>
            <p><strong>Bad sign:</strong> You asked for a casual social media post and got a formal essay. Or you asked for professional copy and got emojis and slang.</p>
            <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> The tone, formality, and style match your request. If they don't — iterate. Say "make it more casual" or "write this like a TikTok caption".</p>

            <h3>✅ 6. Can you spot filler content?</h3>
            <p><strong>Bad sign:</strong> Sentences that sound good but add zero information. AI has several tell-tale filler patterns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>"In today's fast-paced world..."</em> (classic AI throat-clearing)</li>
                <li><em>"It's important to remember that..."</em> (stalling before the actual content)</li>
                <li><em>"There are many ways to approach this..."</em> (vague hedging)</li>
                <li>Restating your question back to you in different words</li>
                <li>Ending with <em>"The possibilities are endless!"</em> (empty enthusiasm)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Good sign:</strong> Every sentence adds new information or value. You couldn't delete a paragraph without losing something useful.</p>

            <h3>✅ 7. The Friend Test</h3>
            <p>The ultimate quality check: <strong>Would you confidently share this with a friend as useful advice?</strong></p>
            <p>If you'd feel embarrassed sending it to someone — if you'd add a caveat like "AI wrote this, so take it with a grain of salt" — the output isn't good enough yet. Iterate until it is.</p>

            <h2>What to Do When Output Is Bad</h2>
            <p>Bad output doesn't mean the AI is broken. It usually means your prompt needs work. Try these fixes:</p>

            <table class="comparison-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>Problem</th><th>Fix</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Too vague</td><td>Add specific context about your situation</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Too generic</td><td>Say "be specific — give concrete examples"</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Wrong tone</td><td>Specify the tone: "write casually, like texting a friend"</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Too long</td><td>Set a word limit: "respond in under 150 words"</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Factually wrong</td><td>Try Gemini (has web access) or say "double-check this"</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Misunderstood the task</td><td>Break your request into smaller, clearer steps</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Full of filler</td><td>Say "remove all filler. Every sentence must add new info"</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>Applying This to Your Soul Blueprint Reading</h2>
            <p>When you use AI to explore your Soul Blueprint reading, use this checklist to evaluate the output:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> Does it reference YOUR actual placements (Sun, Moon, Rising, etc.), or just generic astrology?</li>
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Does it address the specific question you asked, or give you "Astrology 101"?</li>
                <li><strong>Actionability:</strong> Does it give you something you can actually DO, not just think about?</li>
                <li><strong>Nuance:</strong> Does it acknowledge tensions or contradictions in your chart, or just paint a rosy picture?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="prompt-box">
                <div class="prompt-header">
