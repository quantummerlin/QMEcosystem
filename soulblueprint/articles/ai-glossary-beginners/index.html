            <h2>Everyday AI Terms</h2>

            <h3 id="ai">1. AI (Artificial Intelligence)</h3>
            <p>Software that can perform tasks that normally require human thinking — like writing, analysing patterns, or making decisions. When people say "AI" in 2026, they usually mean chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini.</p>

            <h3 id="chatbot">2. Chatbot</h3>
            <p>A program you can have a text conversation with. ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are all chatbots. You type, they respond.</p>

            <h3 id="prompt">3. Prompt</h3>
            <p>The message you type to an AI. Your prompt is your instruction. Better prompts = better results. <a href="../how-to-write-good-ai-prompt/">Learn the formula →</a></p>

            <h3 id="response">4. Response / Output</h3>
            <p>What the AI writes back after you give it a prompt. Also called "output" or "generation".</p>

            <h3 id="hallucination">5. Hallucination</h3>
            <p>When AI confidently makes something up that isn't true. It sounds convincing but is factually wrong. This is why you should always verify important facts. <a href="../how-ai-generates-text/">Learn why this happens →</a></p>

            <h3 id="model">6. Model</h3>
            <p>The "brain" behind the AI. GPT-4o is a model. Gemini 2.0 is a model. Different models have different strengths. When someone says "which model are you using?", they're asking which AI brain powers the tool.</p>

            <h3 id="token">7. Token</h3>
            <p>The unit AI uses to measure text. One token ≈ ¾ of a word. When a tool says "4,000 token limit", it means roughly 3,000 words. You usually don't need to worry about this on free tiers.</p>

            <h3 id="context-window">8. Context Window</h3>
            <p>How much text the AI can "remember" in a single conversation. A larger context window means it can handle longer documents or conversations without forgetting earlier parts.</p>

            <div class="ad-zone"><span class="ad-zone-label">Advertisement</span></div>

            <h2>How AI Works (Behind the Scenes)</h2>

            <h3 id="llm">9. LLM (Large Language Model)</h3>
            <p>The technical name for AI chatbots like ChatGPT. "Large" because it was trained on massive amounts of text. "Language" because it works with words. "Model" because it's a mathematical pattern-matcher.</p>

            <h3 id="training">10. Training</h3>
            <p>How an AI learns. During training, the AI reads billions of text examples and learns patterns — like how sentences are structured, what usually follows what, and how different topics connect.</p>

            <h3 id="training-data">11. Training Data</h3>
            <p>The text the AI learned from. This includes books, websites, articles, and more. The quality and breadth of training data determines how good the AI is.</p>

            <h3 id="fine-tuning">12. Fine-Tuning</h3>
            <p>Extra training on specific content to make an AI better at particular tasks. Think of it as specialisation after general education.</p>

            <h3 id="parameters">13. Parameters</h3>
            <p>The internal "settings" inside an AI model's brain. GPT-4 has over a trillion parameters. More parameters generally = more capable (but also more expensive to run).</p>

            <h3 id="neural-network">14. Neural Network</h3>
            <p>The architecture inside AI that's loosely inspired by how brain neurons connect. Information flows through layers of "neurons" that each process a small part of the task.</p>

            <h3 id="deep-learning">15. Deep Learning</h3>
            <p>A type of AI that uses many layers in its neural network (hence "deep"). This is the technology behind all modern AI chatbots.</p>

            <h2>Using AI Better</h2>

            <h3 id="temperature">16. Temperature</h3>
            <p>A setting that controls how creative vs. predictable the AI's responses are. Low temperature = factual and consistent. High temperature = creative and surprising. Most chatbots handle this automatically.</p>

            <h3 id="system-prompt">17. System Prompt</h3>
            <p>Hidden instructions that tell the AI how to behave. When you use ChatGPT, there's a system prompt you don't see that says things like "be helpful and harmless". Some tools let you set your own.</p>

            <h3 id="few-shot">18. Few-Shot Prompting</h3>
            <p>Giving the AI a few examples of what you want before asking it to do the task. Like showing someone 3 example emails before asking them to write one in the same style.</p>

            <h3 id="chain-of-thought">19. Chain of Thought</h3>
            <p>Asking the AI to "think step by step" before answering. This often produces better results for complex questions because it forces the AI to reason through each part.</p>

            <h3 id="zero-shot">20. Zero-Shot</h3>
            <p>Asking the AI to do something with no examples — just the instruction. Most casual prompts are zero-shot: "Write me a poem about the ocean."</p>

            <div class="ad-zone"><span class="ad-zone-label">Advertisement</span></div>

            <h2>Types of AI</h2>

            <h3 id="generative-ai">21. Generative AI</h3>
            <p>AI that creates new content — text, images, music, code. ChatGPT generates text. DALL-E generates images. All the tools we discuss are generative AI.</p>

            <h3 id="multimodal">22. Multimodal</h3>
            <p>AI that can handle multiple types of input/output — text AND images AND audio. Gemini is multimodal because you can upload photos and get text responses about them.</p>

            <h3 id="nlp">23. NLP (Natural Language Processing)</h3>
            <p>The branch of AI focused on understanding human language. Every chatbot uses NLP to understand your prompts and generate natural-sounding responses.</p>

            <h3 id="computer-vision">24. Computer Vision</h3>
            <p>AI that can "see" and understand images. When you upload a photo to Gemini and it describes what's in it — that's computer vision.</p>

            <h3 id="agi">25. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)</h3>
            <p>The theoretical future AI that could do anything a human can do. We don't have this yet. Current AI is "narrow" — great at specific tasks, but can't truly think or understand like humans.</p>

            <h2>AI Safety & Ethics</h2>

            <h3 id="bias">26. Bias</h3>
            <p>When AI reflects unfair patterns from its training data. If the data over-represents certain perspectives, the AI might too. This is why diverse training data matters.</p>

            <h3 id="guardrails">27. Guardrails</h3>
            <p>Rules built into AI to prevent harmful outputs. When ChatGPT refuses to help with something dangerous, that's a guardrail at work.</p>

            <h3 id="alignment">28. Alignment</h3>
            <p>Making sure AI does what humans actually want it to do. "Aligned" AI is helpful, harmless, and honest. This is one of the biggest challenges in AI development.</p>

            <h3 id="rlhf">29. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)</h3>
            <p>A training method where humans rate AI responses as good or bad, and the AI learns from those ratings. This is how ChatGPT learned to be helpful and conversational.</p>

            <h3 id="open-source">30. Open Source</h3>
            <p>AI models whose code is publicly available for anyone to use, modify, or study. Meta's LLaMA is open-source. ChatGPT is not (it's "closed-source" or "proprietary").</p>
