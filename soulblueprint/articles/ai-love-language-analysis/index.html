        <p>You've probably taken a love language quiz at some point. Words of affirmation, quality time, physical touch, acts of service, receiving gifts — five categories that supposedly explain how you give and receive love. The problem? <strong>Those quizzes rely on what you think you want, not what you actually need.</strong></p>

        <p>Your Soul Blueprint reading cuts through self-reporting bias. Your Venus placement reveals how you express affection. Your Moon sign shows what makes you feel emotionally secure. Your 7th house describes what you need from a partner. <strong>These placements don't lie</strong> — they map to love languages in surprisingly specific ways, and AI can decode the connection for you.</p>

        <p><strong>This guide shows you how to use AI and your <a href="/soulblueprint/">Soul Blueprint reading</a> to identify your true love language</strong> — plus communication tips for every relationship in your life.</p>

                    <p>Gary Chapman's 5 Love Languages describe how people prefer to give and receive love. Here's the quick breakdown — and which placements tend to correlate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Words of Affirmation:</strong> You feel loved through verbal praise, encouragement, and "I love you." Common with strong Mercury/Gemini/3rd house energy and Air-dominant readings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quality Time:</strong> Undivided attention is everything. Common with Moon in Cancer, strong 4th house, and Water-dominant readings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Acts of Service:</strong> Actions speak louder than words. Common with Virgo/Capricorn/6th house energy and Earth-dominant readings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical Touch:</strong> Physical closeness, hugs, hand-holding. Common with Venus in Taurus/Scorpio, strong Mars, and sensory-oriented placements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Receiving Gifts:</strong> Thoughtful tokens that say "I was thinking of you." Common with Venus in Taurus/Libra and 2nd house emphasis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Important: You have a <strong>giving language</strong> (how you express love) and a <strong>receiving language</strong> (how you need to receive love). They're often different — and your reading reveals both.</p>

                        <li><strong>5th house:</strong> Romance, pleasure, and how you flirt</li>

<pre>Analyze my personality reading and determine my love languages. Be specific to MY placements, not generic. Include:

**PRIMARY LOVE LANGUAGE (Receiving):**
- Which of the 5 love languages I most need to receive
- Which placements drive this (Venus, Moon, 7th house, element balance)
- Specific examples: what makes me feel truly loved based on my reading

**SECONDARY LOVE LANGUAGE (Receiving):**
- My runner-up love language and why

**GIVING LOVE LANGUAGE:**
- How I naturally express love (often different from what I need)
- Which placements drive my giving style

**LOVE LANGUAGE IN ACTION:**
- 5 specific things a partner could do that would make me feel deeply loved (based on my placements)
- 5 things I naturally do for others that ARE my way of showing love (even if they don't recognize it)

**COMMUNICATION TIPS:**
- How to tell a partner what I need (based on my communication style from Mercury/3rd house)
- Common misunderstandings my love language creates
- One sentence I could share with a partner: "I feel most loved when..."

**ATTACHMENT STYLE CONNECTION:**
- Based on my Moon and 4th house, what attachment style does my reading suggest?
- How does this interact with my love language?

Be psychologically rich and specific to my actual placements.

                        <strong>💡 The giving vs. receiving gap</strong>
                        Many people give love the way THEY want to receive it — but their partner needs something different. If your Venus says you show love through acts of service but your partner's Moon craves words of affirmation, you're both speaking love in a language the other can't hear. AI can flag this mismatch.

<pre>I have two personality readings — one for me and one for my partner. Analyze our love language compatibility:

1. **Love Language Match:** Do our primary love languages align or conflict?
2. **The Translation Gap:** Where we're "speaking different languages" and how to bridge it
3. **What I Need From Them:** 3 specific things they could do based on MY love language
4. **What They Need From Me:** 3 specific things I could do based on THEIR love language
5. **Shared Ritual:** One weekly ritual that would satisfy BOTH our love languages simultaneously

Be specific and practical — not generic relationship advice.

        <!-- Common Mistakes -->
        <h2 id="mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Assuming love language is fixed.</strong> Your primary love language can shift based on life stage, stress level, and relationship context. Use this as a snapshot, not a permanent label.</li>
            <li><strong>Only analyzing your own reading.</strong> Love languages matter most in the SPACE between two people. Compare readings to get the full picture.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring the Moon sign.</strong> People focus on Venus for love, but your Moon reveals what you need to feel emotionally SAFE — which is the foundation of every love language.</li>
            <li><strong>Using results to criticize a partner.</strong> "Your reading says you're bad at quality time" is weaponizing the tool. Use it for understanding, not ammunition.</li>
            <li><strong>Skipping the giving vs. receiving distinction.</strong> How you show love and how you need to receive it are often different. AI can map both — don't collapse them into one.</li>
