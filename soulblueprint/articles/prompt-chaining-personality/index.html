        <!-- Hook -->
        <p>Most people paste their reading into ChatGPT, ask one question, get one answer, and stop. They've used maybe <strong>5% of what their reading contains</strong>. It's like buying a gourmet meal and only eating the bread.</p>

        <p>Prompt chaining is the technique that changes everything. Instead of asking one isolated question, you <strong>build a sequence of prompts where each one builds on the previous answer</strong>. The AI goes deeper with each step because it has context from everything that came before. By prompt 5 or 6, you're getting insights that a single prompt could never produce.</p>

        <p><strong>This guide teaches you the prompt chaining technique and gives you 3 ready-to-use chain templates</strong> — for self-discovery, career guidance, and relationship insight — each designed to extract maximum value from a single <a href="/soulblueprint/">Soul Blueprint reading</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Why Single Prompts Hit a Ceiling</h3>
                    <button class="step-toggle" aria-label="Toggle step">▼</button>
                </div>
                <div class="tutorial-step-body">
                    <p>A single prompt produces a single layer of analysis. Even a great prompt like "analyze my personality" gives you a broad overview — but it stays on the surface because the AI tries to cover everything at once. It's wide but shallow.</p>
                    <p>Prompt chaining solves this by going <strong>narrow and deep</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> Establishes the foundation (paste your reading, set context)</li>
                        <li><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> Narrows focus to a specific theme</li>
                        <li><strong>Prompt 3:</strong> Explores tensions and contradictions within that theme</li>
                        <li><strong>Prompt 4:</strong> Connects to real-world behavior and decisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Prompt 5:</strong> Generates actionable insights or exercises</li>
                        <li><strong>Prompt 6:</strong> Synthesizes everything into a final output</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each prompt builds on everything before it. By prompt 4, the AI has so much context that it generates insights you've never seen from any reading.</p>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <strong>💡 The golden rule of chaining</strong>
                        Never start a new conversation mid-chain. Every prompt in the chain must be in the <strong>same conversation thread</strong> so the AI remembers everything. If you start a new chat, you lose all accumulated context.

                    <button class="step-toggle" aria-label="Toggle step">▼</button>
                </div>
                <div class="tutorial-step-body">
                    <p>Before diving into the templates, understand what makes a chain work:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Principle 1: Funnel Down.</strong> Start broad, get progressively narrower. Don't start narrow — give the AI the full picture first, then zoom in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Principle 2: Challenge the AI.</strong> At least one prompt in every chain should push back: "What are you missing?" or "What's the opposite interpretation?" This prevents the AI from being a yes-machine.</li>
                        <li><strong>Principle 3: End With Action.</strong> The final prompt should always produce something concrete — an action plan, a profile card, a decision framework, a journal exercise. Insight without action is just entertainment.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>⚠️ Don't skip prompts</strong>
                        Each prompt in the chain builds context for the next. If you skip prompt 3 and jump to prompt 5, the AI won't have the depth of analysis needed to produce a good answer. Run every prompt in order.

Here is my complete Soul Blueprint reading. Summarize my core identity in 3 paragraphs: who I appear to be (rising/persona), who I actually am (sun/moon/core), and where I'm heading (north node/life path).
[PASTE FULL READING]

PROMPT 2 (Narrow):
Now focus on the tensions in my reading. Where do my placements contradict each other? Where does my outer self conflict with my inner self? List the top 3 internal tensions and explain how each one plays out in daily life.

PROMPT 3 (Challenge):
Play devil's advocate. What is the LEAST flattering but most honest interpretation of my reading? What patterns might I be in denial about? Be direct — I want the uncomfortable truth.

PROMPT 4 (Connect):
Based on everything we've discussed, describe 5 specific real-life situations where my personality patterns predictably cause problems. For each, explain the trigger, my likely reaction, and what a more integrated response would look like.

PROMPT 5 (Deepen):
Now look at my Chiron, Lilith, and 12th house together. What is the CORE fear that all three of these placements circle around? Name it clearly. Then explain how this fear has been secretly shaping my choices.

PROMPT 6 (Synthesize):
Create a "Self-Discovery Report" that synthesizes everything from our conversation. Include: Core Identity Summary, Top 3 Tensions, Shadow Pattern, Core Fear, 5 Growth Actions, and a one-paragraph "Letter to Self" written in first person.</pre>

Now identify my career danger zones — roles, environments, and work styles that would drain me based on my reading. What kinds of jobs would slowly destroy my energy? Be specific.

PROMPT 3 (Challenge):
What career would surprise me? Based on my reading, suggest 3 unconventional career paths I probably haven't considered but would actually thrive in. Explain the connection to my placements.

PROMPT 4 (Connect):
Based on everything, create my ideal work environment profile: Team size, leadership style, communication preferences, energy management needs, ideal daily rhythm, and the one thing a job MUST have for me to stay engaged long-term.

PROMPT 5 (Action):

                    <p>The outputs from prompt chains are too valuable to leave buried in a chat log. Here's how to preserve them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Copy the final synthesis</strong> (the last prompt's output) into a note-taking app or document</li>
                        <li><strong>Screenshot profile cards</strong> and save them to a "Self-Knowledge" album on your phone</li>
                        <li><strong>Create a personal wiki</strong> — a single document that collects all your chain outputs: Self-Discovery Report, Career Compass, Relationship Blueprint, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Revisit quarterly.</strong> Re-run your favorite chains every 3 months to see how your self-understanding evolves</li>
                    </ul>

        <!-- Common Mistakes -->
        <h2 id="mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Starting a new chat mid-chain.</strong> The whole point of chaining is accumulated context. New chat = lost context = shallow answers. Stay in one thread.</li>
            <li><strong>Skipping the challenge prompt.</strong> If you only ask flattering questions, AI will only give flattering answers. The "devil's advocate" prompt is where the real insight lives.</li>
            <li><strong>Running chains too fast.</strong> Read each output carefully before sending the next prompt. If the AI missed something important, redirect before moving on — don't just rush through.</li>
            <li><strong>Using chains that are too long.</strong> After 6-7 prompts, even good AI starts losing coherence. Keep chains to 5-7 prompts max. Start a new chain for a new topic.</li>
            <li><strong>Not saving the outputs.</strong> A brilliant chain output that disappears into chat history is wasted insight. Copy and save every final synthesis.</li>
        </ol>
