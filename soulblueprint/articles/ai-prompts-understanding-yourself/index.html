            <p class="article-hook">You've tried the basic prompts. You know your Sun sign's strengths and your Moon sign's emotional style. Now it's time to go deeper — into the parts of yourself that are harder to see, harder to admit, and harder to change. These 15 prompts are designed for real self-understanding, not just entertainment.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>💡 Before you start:</strong> These prompts work best after you've <a href="../../#generator">generated your full reading</a> and already explored the basics with the <a href="../best-ai-prompts-self-discovery/">25 starter prompts</a>.
