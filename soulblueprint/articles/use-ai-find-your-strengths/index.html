            <p class="article-hook">You probably know your obvious strengths. But your personality reading contains clues to strengths you might not recognise — abilities that feel so natural you don't think of them as special. This guided exercise helps you find them.</p>

            <div class="ad-zone"><!-- Ad 1 --></div>

            <h2>Why Hidden Strengths Matter</h2>
            <p>Research in positive psychology shows that people who use their signature strengths daily are significantly happier and more productive. But most people can only name 2-3 of their strengths. Your personality reading likely reveals 8-10.</p>
            <p>The "hidden" ones are often your most powerful — because they come so naturally you don't even recognise them as strengths.</p>

            <h2>The 5-Step Strengths Discovery Exercise</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Extract Your Obvious Strengths</h3>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <div class="prompt-header">
                    <span>Obvious strengths prompt</span>
                    <button class="copy-btn" data-copy="Based on this personality reading, identify my 5 most obvious strengths — the ones that are clearly stated or strongly implied. For each, explain: 1) What it is in plain language, 2) How it probably shows up in my daily life, 3) A situation where this strength really shines. Here's my reading: [paste reading]">📋 Copy</button>
                </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Uncover Your Hidden Strengths</h3>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <div class="prompt-header">
                    <span>Hidden strengths prompt</span>
                    <button class="copy-btn" data-copy="Now look deeper. Based on the COMBINATION of traits in my reading (not individual placements), what strengths emerge that aren't immediately obvious? These are strengths that: - Come from the interaction of two or more traits - Might feel so natural to me that I don't consider them special - Other personality types would find difficult. Identify 5 hidden strengths I might not recognise in myself.">📋 Copy</button>

            <h3>Step 3: Validate With Evidence</h3>
            <p>This is the crucial step most people skip. For each strength AI identified, ask yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can I think of a specific time this showed up in my life?</li>
                <li>Have other people ever commented on this ability?</li>
                <li>Does it feel easy and natural to me (even if others struggle with it)?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you answer yes to at least 2 of 3, it's likely a real strength.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Create Your Strengths Map</h3>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <div class="prompt-header">
                    <span>Strengths map prompt</span>

Format as a clean table I could save as a reference.">📋 Copy</button>
