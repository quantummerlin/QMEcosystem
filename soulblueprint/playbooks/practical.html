                    <pre class="prompt-text">You are a holistic life coach and productivity expert who specialises in aligning daily routines with astrological and numerological profiles. Your task is to create a complete, practical daily routine — both morning and evening — based on my soul blueprint readings. This should not be generic wellness advice. Every recommendation must be specifically tied to my placements and readings.

Here are my soul blueprint readings:

[PASTE YOUR READINGS HERE]

Create the following daily routine plan:

MORNING ROUTINE (from waking to starting work/responsibilities)

1. OPTIMAL WAKE TIME — Based on my Sun sign element (fire/earth/air/water) and Moon sign, suggest an ideal wake-up window. Explain why this timing suits my energy pattern.

2. FIRST 15 MINUTES — What should I do immediately after waking? Use my Rising sign (how I meet the world) and Moon sign (emotional needs) to design a grounding ritual. Be specific: meditation type, journaling prompt, movement style, or breathwork technique.

3. PHYSICAL MOVEMENT — Based on my Mars sign and element, what type of morning exercise fits me best? Suggest 2–3 specific activities (not just "exercise"), duration, and intensity level. A fire Mars needs something different from a water Mars.

4. NOURISHMENT — Based on my elemental balance (count how many fire/earth/air/water placements I have), suggest a morning eating style. Quick and energetic? Slow and grounding? Structured meal prep? Intuitive grazing? Suggest specific food categories that match my elemental needs.

5. MENTAL PREPARATION — Based on my Mercury sign and 3rd House reading, design a 10-minute mental warm-up. This could be reading, puzzles, creative writing, learning a language, listening to a specific type of podcast — whatever matches how my mind boots up best.

6. INTENTION SETTING — Based on my North Node and Life Path number, create a daily intention-setting practice. Give me a specific template or question I should ask myself each morning to stay aligned with my soul's direction.

EVENING ROUTINE (from finishing work/responsibilities to sleep)

7. TRANSITION RITUAL — Based on my 6th House reading and Saturn placement, design a boundary between "work mode" and "rest mode." How should I officially close the day? A specific shutdown ritual that matches my chart.

8. EMOTIONAL PROCESSING — Based on my Moon sign and 4th House reading, create an evening emotional check-in practice. Journaling prompts, conversation rituals with loved ones, or solo reflection methods that honour how I process feelings.

9. CREATIVE OR PLEASURE TIME — Based on my Venus sign and 5th House reading, suggest evening activities that genuinely replenish me. Not generic "self-care" — specific hobbies, art forms, entertainment styles, and social activities aligned to my Venus expression.

10. WIND-DOWN — Based on my 12th House reading and any Neptune placements, design a pre-sleep ritual. What helps my specific chart type transition to rest? Specific music genres, lighting, reading material, meditation style, or sleep environment adjustments.

11. OPTIMAL SLEEP TIME — Based on the overall energy arc of my chart, suggest an ideal bedtime window and explain the reasoning.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Present each item as a clear, actionable step with a specific time window (e.g., "6:30 AM – 6:45 AM")
- Include the astrological reasoning in italics after each recommendation
- At the end, provide a ONE-PAGE SUMMARY that could be printed and taped to a bathroom mirror
- Keep the total routine realistic — the morning routine should take 60–90 minutes, the evening routine 45–60 minutes
- Flag any areas where my chart suggests I'll resist routine (mutable signs, Uranus aspects) and offer flexibility strategies</pre>

Here are my soul blueprint readings:

[PASTE YOUR READINGS HERE]

Create the following career guidance plan:

PART 1 — CORE CAREER PROFILE

1. PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY — Based on my Midheaven sign and 10th House reading, describe my ideal professional reputation. What do I want to be known for? What's my "brand" in the professional world? Be specific — not "a leader" but the specific type of leader my chart describes.

2. TOP 5 CAREER PATHS — Based on the full picture of my chart (Midheaven, 10th House, 6th House, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Life Path number, and North Node), list 5 specific career paths ranked from most aligned to strong alternative. For each, provide:
   - Job title and industry
   - Why this matches my chart (cite specific placements)
   - Entry point (how to start or pivot into this field)
   - Growth trajectory (where this path leads in 5–10 years)

3. WORK ENVIRONMENT — Based on my Sun and Moon elements, Rising sign, and 6th House reading, describe my ideal work setting. Remote vs. office? Solo vs. team? Structured vs. flexible? Fast-paced vs. methodical? Creative vs. analytical? Startup vs. established? Describe the physical and cultural environment where I'll thrive.

4. WORK STYLE — Based on my Mars sign and Saturn placement, describe how I work best. My approach to deadlines, projects, collaboration, and leadership. Am I a sprinter or a marathoner? A builder or a disruptor? A specialist or a generalist?

PART 2 — STRENGTHS AND BLIND SPOTS

5. TOP 5 PROFESSIONAL STRENGTHS — Based on my strongest placements (look for well-aspected planets, angular houses, and dominant elements), list 5 specific professional strengths. Not personality traits — actual workplace skills and capabilities.

6. 3 CAREER BLIND SPOTS — Based on challenging aspects (squares, oppositions), Chiron, and Saturn, identify 3 specific areas where I'm likely to struggle professionally. For each, provide a concrete mitigation strategy.

7. LEADERSHIP STYLE — Based on my Sun, Mars, and 10th House, describe whether and how I should lead. Some charts are natural CEOs; others are brilliant advisors, mentors, or independent operators. What's my leadership archetype?

PART 3 — ACTIONABLE STRATEGY

8. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS — Based on my current position in my numerological cycles (Life Path, current year), list 3 specific things I should do in the next 30 days to align my career with my chart. These should be concrete actions, not "reflect on your goals."

9. SKILL DEVELOPMENT PLAN — Based on my Mercury and 9th House readings, suggest 3 specific skills or certifications that would accelerate my most-aligned career path. Include how to learn them (books, courses, certifications, mentors).

10. NETWORKING STRATEGY — Based on my 7th and 11th House readings and Venus sign, describe how I build professional relationships best. Am I a one-on-one connector or a community builder? Should I attend conferences or cultivate deep mentorships?

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use headers and bullet points for scannability
- Each career suggestion must cite the specific reading it's based on
- Include a CAREER SUMMARY CARD at the end: a 5-line snapshot I could put at the top of my CV or LinkedIn profile
- Be bold and specific — I'd rather have 5 focused suggestions than 20 vague ones
- If my chart shows tension between security and risk (Saturn vs. Uranus, for example), address this directly and suggest how to balance both</pre>

Here are my soul blueprint readings:

[PASTE YOUR READINGS HERE]

Create the following relationship guide:

PART 1 — YOUR LOVE LANGUAGE (DECODED)

1. ATTACHMENT STYLE — Based on my Moon sign, 4th House, and Chiron reading, identify my likely attachment style (secure, anxious, avoidant, or fearful-avoidant). Explain how my chart creates this pattern and what triggers insecurity in me. Be specific, not textbook.

2. WHAT I NEED IN A PARTNER — Based on my 7th House reading, Venus sign, and Descendant, describe the specific qualities I'm drawn to in a partner. Not "someone kind" — the specific type of energy, communication style, emotional depth, and lifestyle that my chart craves.

3. HOW I EXPRESS LOVE — Based on my Venus sign, Mars sign, and Moon sign, describe my love expression in practical terms. Am I a gift-giver, a words person, a physical touch person, a quality time person, or an acts-of-service person? How does this show up in daily life? Be concrete.

4. CONFLICT STYLE — Based on my Mars sign, any Mars aspects, and my Mercury reading, describe how I handle relationship conflict. Do I confront, avoid, intellectualise, emotionalise, or shut down? What's my pattern, and what does my partner need to know about arguing with me?

PART 2 — RELATIONSHIP PATTERNS

5. REPEATING PATTERNS — Based on my South Node, Chiron, and Lilith readings, identify 2–3 relationship patterns I likely repeat. Past-life karma, childhood wounds, and shadow dynamics that show up in partnerships. For each pattern, provide a specific awareness practice to break the cycle.

6. THE WOUND IN LOVE — Based on my Chiron and Venus readings, describe my core relationship wound. The fear that lives underneath my romantic behaviour. Name it plainly, explain how it manifests, and provide 3 specific strategies for healing it.

7. IDEAL RELATIONSHIP DYNAMIC — Based on my 7th House, Venus, Mars, and North Node, describe the relationship dynamic I'm growing toward (not the one I default to). What does a healthy, evolved relationship look like for my specific chart?

PART 3 — PRACTICAL RELATIONSHIP STRATEGIES

8. COMMUNICATION IN LOVE — Based on my Mercury sign and any aspects to Venus or Moon, provide 5 specific communication strategies for my relationships. How should I bring up difficult topics? How should my partner communicate with me for best results? Be tactical.

9. FRIENDSHIP BLUEPRINT — Based on my 11th House reading, Venus, and Mercury, describe what I need in friendships. How many close friends does my chart suggest? What kind of social life suits me? How do I maintain friendships best?

10. PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS — Based on my 7th House, 10th House, and Mars, describe how I function in professional partnerships. Am I better as a solo operator, a collaborator, a leader, or a right-hand person? What kind of colleague am I?

11. RELATIONSHIP ACTION PLAN — Based on the full picture, provide 5 concrete things I can do this month to improve my most important relationship. Not "communicate better" — specific scripts, rituals, date ideas, or boundary-setting strategies derived from my chart.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Write in direct, practical language — this is a user manual, not poetry
- Each insight must cite the specific reading or placement it's based on
- Include a RELATIONSHIP QUICK-REFERENCE CARD at the end: 10 bullet points summarising my relationship profile that I could share with a partner
- Be honest about challenges — every chart has relational blind spots
- If my chart shows conflicting needs (e.g., craving independence and deep intimacy), address the tension directly with practical strategies for honouring both</pre>

Dry or moist? How does this affect my baseline physical state? Use the four-element model to paint a clear picture of my body type and energy signature.

2. EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION — Based on my Mars sign, Mars aspects, and elemental balance, prescribe 3 specific exercise types ranked by alignment. For each, include:
   - The activity and why it matches my Mars expression
   - Recommended frequency and duration
   - Best time of day based on my energy pattern
   - How to stay motivated (because my chart will predict how I fall off — address that)

3. NUTRITION TENDENCIES — Based on my elemental balance, Moon sign, and 6th House reading, describe my likely relationship with food. Am I an emotional eater, a structured meal-planner, a grazer, or a feast-or-famine type? Suggest a general eating philosophy (not a specific diet) that honours my chart's relationship with nourishment.

4. REST AND RECOVERY — Based on my Moon sign, 12th House, and any Neptune readings, describe my rest needs. How much sleep does my chart suggest I need? What kind of rest replenishes me — solitude, social recharging, physical rest, or mental quiet? Design a weekly rest schedule.

PART 2 — EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL WELLNESS

5. STRESS PROFILE — Based on my Saturn placement, any challenging aspects (squares, oppositions), and Mars sign, describe my stress pattern. What triggers stress in me? How does it manifest physically? What's my typical stress response (fight, flight, freeze, or fawn)? Provide 3 specific stress-management techniques that match my chart.

6. EMOTIONAL REGULATION — Based on my Moon sign, water placements, and 4th House reading, describe my emotional landscape. Am I emotionally expressive or contained? Quick to feel or slow to process? Provide 3 specific practices for emotional health that honour how my chart processes feelings — not generic mindfulness, but techniques matched to my lunar nature.

7. MENTAL HEALTH MAINTENANCE — Based on my Mercury sign, air placements, and any 12th House readings, describe my mental health tendencies. Is my mind prone to overthinking, anxiety, dissociation, rumination, or scattered focus? Provide 3 specific cognitive wellness strategies matched to my chart.

PART 3 — LIFESTYLE INTEGRATION

8. ENERGY MANAGEMENT — Based on my Sun sign, Mars, and overall chart, map my daily energy curve. When am I naturally sharpest? When does my energy dip? Create a simple energy schedule: peak hours, moderate hours, and rest hours. Suggest how to structure demanding tasks around this curve.

9. SEASONAL WELLNESS — Based on my elemental balance and any relevant cycle readings, describe which seasons challenge me most and which energise me. Provide 2 seasonal adjustments I should make (e.g., winter strategies for a fire-dominant chart).

10. WELLNESS QUICK-START — Based on everything above, list the TOP 5 THINGS I should implement first for maximum impact. Rank them by ease and effectiveness. Make them specific enough to start tomorrow.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear headers and bullet points throughout
- Each recommendation must cite the specific reading it's based on
- Include a ONE-PAGE WELLNESS SNAPSHOT at the end: a printable summary of my constitutional type, ideal exercise, eating philosophy, stress triggers, and top 5 practices
- Be practical and realistic — suggest things that fit into a normal life, not a retreat centre
- Include a disclaimer that this is lifestyle guidance, not medical advice, and to consult healthcare professionals for medical concerns</pre>

   - Visual (diagrams, videos, colour-coding, mind maps)
   - Auditory (lectures, podcasts, discussion, reading aloud)
   - Reading/Writing (books, notes, essays, summarising)
   - Kinesthetic (hands-on practice, experiments, movement, building)
   For each method, provide a specific implementation strategy.

6. STUDY SCHEDULE — Based on my energy pattern (Sun, Mars) and cognitive rhythm (Mercury, Moon), design an ideal weekly study schedule. When should I tackle difficult material? When should I review? When should I take breaks? Include specific time blocks.

PART 3 — GROWTH AND APPLICATION

7. INTELLECTUAL STRENGTHS — Based on my Mercury, Jupiter, 3rd House, and 9th House readings, identify 3 specific intellectual strengths. Not generic traits — actual cognitive advantages I can leverage. For each, suggest how to use it strategically.

8. LEARNING CHALLENGES — Based on challenging Mercury aspects, Saturn readings, and any 12th House influences, identify 2–3 specific learning challenges I likely face. Procrastination? Perfectionism? Scattered focus? Test anxiety? For each, provide a specific coping strategy derived from my chart.

9. SUBJECTS AND TOPICS — Based on my full chart (especially 3rd House, 9th House, Jupiter, Mercury, and Midheaven), suggest 5 subjects or skill areas I'd find naturally engaging. These could be academic subjects, practical skills, creative disciplines, or professional domains. Explain why each matches my chart.

10. LEARNING ACTION PLAN — Based on everything above, provide a LEARNING TOOLKIT: 7 specific tools, apps, techniques, or resources I should use based on my profile. Not generic study tips — tools matched to my cognitive style.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear headers and bullet points throughout
- Each recommendation must cite the specific reading it's based on

Here are my soul blueprint readings:

[PASTE YOUR READINGS HERE]

Create the following communication guide:

PART 1 — YOUR COMMUNICATION DNA

1. VERBAL STYLE — Based on my Mercury sign, Mercury aspects, and 3rd House reading, describe how I naturally speak and write. Am I concise or expansive? Logical or emotional? Direct or diplomatic? Do I think before I speak or think while speaking? Describe my verbal signature — the way my words "sound" to others.

2. LISTENING STYLE — Based on my Moon sign, water placements, and any empathic indicators in my chart, describe how I listen. Am I an active listener or an impatient one? Do I listen to respond or listen to understand? What do I focus on — words, tone, body language, or the emotional undercurrent? How can I leverage or improve my listening?

3. NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION — Based on my Rising sign, Mars sign, and overall elemental balance, describe my body language signature. What energy do I project when I enter a room? How do I use space, eye contact, gestures, and physical presence? What first impression do I create, and is it accurate?

4. WRITTEN COMMUNICATION — Based on my Mercury sign and any air or earth placements, describe my writing style. Am I a clear, structured writer or a flowing, associative one? How should I approach emails, messages, and professional documents to play to my strengths?

PART 2 — COMMUNICATION IN ACTION

5. IN CONFLICT — Based on my Mars sign, Mars aspects, and Moon sign, describe how I communicate when upset or in disagreement. Do I escalate, withdraw, intellectualise, or people-please? Provide 3 specific scripts I can use during conflict that honour my natural style while being more effective:
   - A script for expressing frustration without attacking
   - A script for setting a boundary
   - A script for asking for what I need

6. IN INTIMACY — Based on my Venus sign, Moon sign, and 4th House reading, describe how I communicate in close relationships. How do I express love verbally? What words do I need to hear? What communication habits strengthen my relationships? Provide 3 specific phrases or practices for deepening intimate communication.

7. IN PROFESSIONAL SETTINGS — Based on my Midheaven, 10th House, and Mercury sign, describe my professional communication style. How do I present in meetings? How should I approach presentations, emails to superiors, and networking conversations? Provide 3 specific strategies for professional communication success.

8. IN GROUPS — Based on my 11th House reading, Jupiter sign, and air placements, describe how I function in group discussions, social gatherings, and community settings. Am I a natural moderator, a provocateur, a quiet observer, or the life of the conversation? How can I contribute most effectively in group settings?

PART 3 — GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT

9. COMMUNICATION STRENGTHS — Based on my strongest communication placements, identify 3 specific communication superpowers I possess. Not vague traits — real, observable skills. For each, describe how to use it more intentionally.

10. COMMUNICATION BLIND SPOTS — Based on challenging Mercury aspects, Saturn readings, and any shadow content, identify 3 specific areas where my communication breaks down. Misreading tone? Over-explaining? Avoiding hard conversations? Being too blunt? For each, provide a specific improvement strategy.

11. THE 30-DAY COMMUNICATION UPGRADE — Based on my full profile, design a 30-day improvement plan. Week 1: [focus area]. Week 2: [focus area]. Week 3: [focus area]. Week 4: [integration]. Each week should have one specific daily practice that takes less than 5 minutes.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear headers and bullet points throughout
- Include actual scripts and phrase templates I can use immediately
- Each insight must cite the specific reading it's based on
- Include a COMMUNICATION QUICK-REFERENCE CARD at the end: a one-page summary of my style, strengths, blind spots, and top 5 strategies
- Be direct and practical — this is a field manual, not a personality profile
- If my chart shows contradictions (e.g., Mercury in a bold sign but Moon in a shy sign), address how these create internal tension and how to manage it</pre>

                    <h4>Paste more readings, not fewer</h4>
                    <p>The AI can only work with what you give it. Pasting your entire soul blueprint produces dramatically more specific and actionable plans than pasting just a few sections. When in doubt, paste everything — the AI will select the most relevant pieces for each section.</p>

                    <p>Don't try to overhaul your routine, career, relationships, health, learning, and communication all at once. Pick the section that feels most urgent, implement it for 2–4 weeks, then move to the next one. Sustainable change beats dramatic overhaul every time.</p>

                    <h4>Use follow-up prompts for refinement</h4>
                    <p>After generating any plan, test it against reality. Then return to the AI: "I tried your daily routine for a week. Here's what worked and what didn't: [your feedback]. Adjust the plan." Iterative refinement makes every plan 10× better.</p>
