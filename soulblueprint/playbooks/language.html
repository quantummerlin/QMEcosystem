                <h3>Same Truth, Different Doors</h3>
                <p>Your soul blueprint contains <strong>profound self-knowledge</strong> — planetary placements, house interpretations, numerological cycles, karmic patterns, and more. But the way that knowledge is <em>delivered</em> determines whether it lands or bounces off. A mystical reading that gives one person chills may feel vague to another. A clinical analysis that one person trusts may feel cold to someone else. Language isn't just decoration — it's the <strong>doorway through which meaning enters</strong>. This playbook gives you the keys to every door. Same cosmic truth, infinitely adaptable packaging.</p>

Simplify this reading so that a 13–14 year old could easily understand it. Use short sentences, common words, and clear explanations. Replace all jargon and technical terms with simple equivalents — explain concepts instead of naming them. Use relatable analogies from everyday life: school, friendships, hobbies, sports, social media. Keep paragraphs short (2–3 sentences max). Add friendly, encouraging language throughout.

Rules:
- No sentence longer than 20 words
- No word longer than 3 syllables unless it's a name (like "Mercury" or "Sagittarius")
- Explain every astrological or numerological concept in plain language
- Use "you" language throughout — make it personal and direct
- Keep the full meaning — simplify the language, not the insight

Each insight should be unpacked with "why it matters" context. Include practical implications alongside theoretical depth.

Rules:
- Average sentence length: 15–25 words with varied structure
- Use transitional phrases that show analytical thinking ("This suggests," "The interplay between," "What makes this particularly significant is")
- Reference relevant thinkers, schools of thought, or cultural parallels where appropriate
- Layer each insight: state it, explain it, contextualise it, apply it

Treat each placement as a data point in a larger personality model. Cross-reference insights with established psychological and sociological theories.

Rules:
- Use formal academic register throughout — no colloquialisms, no second person
- Frame insights as hypotheses or theoretical propositions
- Reference relevant scholars and frameworks: Jung, Campbell, Hillman, Tarnas, Grof, Rudhyar
- Use discipline-specific terminology with precision
- Include a synthesis section that integrates all findings into a coherent theoretical model
- Add a "Limitations and Further Inquiry" note at the end

The reading should feel like ancient wisdom literature — applicable to anyone with these placements, yet still deeply specific in its insights.

Rules:
- Use archetypal framing: "One who," "The bearer of," "Those born with," "A soul marked by"
- The tone should be timeless, wise, and slightly elevated — like reading from a sacred text or philosophical treatise
- Remove all personal pronouns (no "you," "I," or "they") — replace with archetypal references

                    <pre class="prompt-text">Rewrite this soul blueprint reading through a Western astrological and psychological framework:

[PASTE YOUR READING HERE]

Reframe this reading using the language and concepts of Western astrology, Jungian psychology, and Greco-Roman mythology. Ground every insight in the Western tradition: reference the Greek/Roman gods behind the planets, connect to Jungian archetypes (Shadow, Anima/Animus, Self), and frame growth in terms of individuation and self-actualisation. Use the Western elemental system (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and modal qualities (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) as organising frameworks.

Rules:
- Reference specific mythological stories connected to the person's placements (e.g., Mercury → Hermes the Trickster)
- Use Jungian terminology naturally: individuation, shadow work, projection, the collective unconscious
- Frame challenges as "shadow material" and strengths as "conscious integration"
- Connect to Western philosophical traditions where relevant: Stoicism, Neoplatonism, Hermeticism
- Keep the full depth and all specific insights — enrich them with Western cultural context

The result should feel like a reading from a classically trained Western astrologer who also holds a degree in depth psychology.</pre>

                    <pre class="prompt-text">Rewrite this soul blueprint reading through an Eastern philosophical lens:

[PASTE YOUR READING HERE]

Reframe this reading using the language and concepts of Eastern philosophy — drawing from Vedic astrology (Jyotish), Buddhism, Taoism, Hindu philosophy, and traditional Chinese thought. Replace Western psychological framing with Eastern wisdom concepts: karma, dharma, the Tao, the Middle Way, the chakra system, the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), yin-yang balance, and the concept of non-attachment. Frame the soul's journey in terms of spiritual evolution across lifetimes rather than individual self-improvement.

Rules:
- Reference Vedic/Eastern equivalents where possible (e.g., Saturn → Shani, nodes → Rahu/Ketu)
- Use concepts like dharma (life purpose), karma (cause and effect), moksha (liberation), and samsara (cycle of rebirth)
- Frame challenges as karmic lessons and strengths as accumulated spiritual merit
- Incorporate the language of meditation, mindfulness, and inner stillness
- Connect to Eastern philosophical traditions: Vedanta, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucian harmony
- Keep the full depth and all specific insights — reframe them through Eastern cultural wisdom

The result should feel like a reading from a Vedic astrologer steeped in Eastern philosophy — contemplative, karmic, and oriented toward spiritual liberation rather than worldly achievement.</pre>

                <div class="prompt-box">
                    <pre class="prompt-text">Rewrite this soul blueprint reading through an Indigenous wisdom lens:

[PASTE YOUR READING HERE]

Reframe this reading using the language and worldview of Indigenous wisdom traditions — honouring the interconnectedness of all life, the sacredness of nature, ancestral guidance, and the medicine wheel. Replace individualistic framing with relational and communal perspectives. Frame the soul's journey in terms of one's relationship to the land, the ancestors, the community, and the natural world. Use the language of medicine, ceremony, seasons, animal totems, and the sacred circle.

Rules:
- Frame identity in terms of relationship: "Your medicine is," "You walk with," "Your ancestors gifted you"
- Use nature-based metaphors: seasons, elements, animal guides, plant medicine, water, stone, fire, wind
- Emphasise community role: how this person serves their people, what they bring to the circle
- Frame challenges as initiations and strengths as medicine (gifts to be shared)
- Honour cyclical time rather than linear progress: seasons of life, spiralling growth, returning wisdom
- Approach with deep respect — frame this as "inspired by" Indigenous perspectives, not claiming to represent any specific nation or tradition
- Keep the full depth and all specific insights — reframe them through a relational, earth-centred worldview

The result should feel like sitting with an elder by the fire — grounded, relational, and deeply connected to the living world. It should honour the wisdom of Indigenous traditions with humility and reverence.</pre>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Transform one reading section at a time</h4>
                    <p>Language transformations work best with focused input. Instead of pasting your entire blueprint, paste one specific reading (e.g., your Sun reading, your Moon reading, or your Life Path reading) and transform that. This produces cleaner, more coherent rewrites than trying to transform everything at once.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Compare versions side by side</h4>
                    <p>The real magic happens when you read multiple versions of the same reading back to back. Try your Sun reading in Mystical voice, then Clinical, then Poetic. You'll discover which voice makes you <em>feel</em> most seen — and that tells you something important about yourself too.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Mix and match transformations</h4>
                    <p>You can combine categories in a single prompt. Try: "Rewrite this in a Poetic voice, at an 8th grade reading level, in the first person, through an Eastern philosophy lens." The AI handles layered instructions beautifully, and the results are often the most unique and personal.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Use transformations for sharing</h4>
                    <p>Want to share your reading with a sceptical friend? Use the Clinical voice. A spiritually-minded partner? Mystical voice. A teenager? Simple reading level with Casual voice. Language transformations let you gift your cosmic insights in whatever wrapper the recipient will actually open.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Stay in one AI conversation thread</h4>
                    <p>Generate multiple transformations in the same conversation. The AI will remember your original reading and produce increasingly refined, internally consistent rewrites. By version #3, you'll notice it developing its own creative interpretations of your placements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Request hybrid voices</h4>
                    <p>Don't feel limited to the five voices listed. Ask for "a blend of Poetic and Scientific" or "Casual but with moments of Mystical depth." The prompts here are starting points — the AI can create infinite variations between and beyond them.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Cultural adaptations require sensitivity</h4>
                    <p>The cultural lens prompts are designed to respectfully explore different wisdom traditions. They're tools for expanding your perspective, not for appropriating or trivialising any culture. Use them with curiosity and respect, and remember that each tradition holds lifetimes of depth beyond what any single prompt can capture.</p>
