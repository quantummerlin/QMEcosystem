# Soul Blueprint — AI Executive Board

## What This Is

A permanent strategic layer embedded in the repository. Seven specialised agents, each with a constrained mandate, that function as your internal AI executive team for the QuantumMerlin / Soul Blueprint ecosystem.

These are **not prompts you fire once**. They are reusable decision-making frameworks you invoke in sequence inside VS Code with GitHub Copilot whenever you need strategic or implementation work done.

## The Board

| # | Agent | File | One-Line Mandate |

| 2 | **Retention Loop Engineer** | [retention_engineer.md](retention_engineer.md) | Increase return visits, reduce churn, build habit loops. |
| 3 | **Conversion Architect** | [conversion_architect.md](conversion_architect.md) | Maximise conversion rate on every landing page and sales flow. |
| 4 | **Funnel Architect** | [funnel_architect.md](funnel_architect.md) | Design the full user journey from free entry to highest-ticket offer. |
| 5 | **Product Differentiation Strategist** | [differentiation_strategist.md](differentiation_strategist.md) | Protect and sharpen positioning against commodity competitors. |
| 6 | **Data Feedback Agent** | [data_feedback_agent.md](data_feedback_agent.md) | Define metrics, identify tracking gaps, propose A/B tests. |
| 7 | **Trust & Compliance Guardian** | [trust_compliance_guardian.md](trust_compliance_guardian.md) | Ensure legal safety, ethical integrity, and brand longevity. |

## How to Invoke an Agent

Open **GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code and use one of these patterns:

```
Follow the instructions in agents/monetization_architect.md and audit this project.
```

```
Follow agents/conversion_architect.md and rewrite the hero section of index.html.
```

```
Follow agents/data_feedback_agent.md and define the tracking plan for Soul Blueprint.
```

You can also reference two agents together for cross-functional work:

```
Follow agents/monetization_architect.md and agents/funnel_architect.md to design the upgrade path from free reading to paid PDF.
```

## Sequencing — The Board Meeting Protocol

Do **not** activate all agents simultaneously. Use this disciplined sequence:

### Phase 1 — Positioning & Conversion (Week 1)
1. **Differentiation Strategist** — Sharpen positioning, language, and intellectual moat.
2. **Conversion Architect** — Rewrite landing page using differentiated positioning.

### Phase 2 — Revenue Architecture (Week 2)
3. **Monetization Architect** — Design pricing tiers, upsells, and bundles.
4. **Funnel Architect** — Map the full journey from free to highest-ticket.

### Phase 3 — Engagement & Retention (Week 3)
5. **Retention Loop Engineer** — Build habit loops, progress systems, and return triggers.

### Phase 4 — Measurement & Compliance (Week 4)
6. **Data Feedback Agent** — Define KPIs, implement tracking, propose first A/B tests.
7. **Trust & Compliance Guardian** — Final audit for claims, legal exposure, and ethics.

### Ongoing
8. **Ecosystem Orchestrator** — Quarterly strategic review across all QuantumMerlin products.

## Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness.** Each agent has a tight role. Overlap is eliminated.
2. **Strategy before code.** Agents propose strategy first. Implementation only after approval.
3. **Sequential orchestration.** One agent at a time. Each builds on the output of the last.
4. **Continuous iteration.** Run the full board cycle quarterly. Run individual agents as needed.
5. **Ethics are non-negotiable.** The Trust & Compliance Guardian has veto power over any agent's output.

## Project Context (for all agents)

- **Product:** Soul Blueprint — a 65+ reading astrology/numerology personality system
- **Tech:** Static HTML/JS, deployable to any hosting (Vercel, Cloudflare, GitHub Pages)
- **Brands:** Multi-brand via config swap (Baby, K-Pop, Stranger Things, default)
- **Revenue today:** AdSense (not yet activated), manual monetization via MONETIZATION.md
- **Ecosystem:** Part of QuantumMerlin.com — future tools include Telegram bots, breathing apps, frequency generators
- **Stage:** Pre-revenue, feature-complete MVP, needs monetization + growth architecture
