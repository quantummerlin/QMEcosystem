    Aries: {
        title: "Uranus in Aries - Revolutionary Pioneer",
        archetype: "The Lightning Strike Leader",
        hook: "With Uranus in Aries, this soul carries revolutionary courage and the ability to lead humanity into new territories. They are here to break trails, shatter limitations, and inspire others to be free.",
        
        coreExpression: `Uranus in Aries creates the revolutionary warrior - someone who isn't just rebelling for its own sake but pioneering genuinely new ways of being. This is the innovator who acts, the rebel who leads, the awakener who goes first.

This placement combines Uranian breakthrough energy with Aries initiative. They don't just think about revolution - they embody it. They don't theorize about freedom - they live it immediately.

Their gift is the capacity to start movements, to be the first to try what everyone else fears, to break through barriers with sudden decisive action. They are lightning strikes of change.`,
        
        innovation: `Their innovation is action-based and immediate. While others are planning revolutions, they're already implementing them. They invent new ways of doing, being, and moving through the world.

They may pioneer new sports, new forms of activism, new leadership models, or entirely new ways of being independent. Their creativity is kinetic and often physical.

The key is that their innovations don't wait for approval or consensus. They act on their genius immediately, often surprising themselves as much as others with what they create.`,
        
        rebellion: `Their rebellion is personal and direct. They refuse to be controlled, dominated, or told what to do. Authority figures trigger immediate revolutionary response.

But their rebellion isn't just reactive - it's creative. They don't just break rules; they demonstrate better ways. They don't just fight systems; they build alternatives by living them.

The most powerful expression is the rebel who doesn't need to fight because they're so busy creating freedom that the old system becomes irrelevant.`,
        
        freedom: `Freedom for them is immediate and non-negotiable. They need autonomy in action - the ability to move, choose, and lead without constraint. Any attempt to control them triggers crisis.

Their freedom isn't philosophical - it's visceral. They need to feel free in their body, in their choices, in their capacity to act on impulse. Spontaneity is oxygen.

The challenge is learning that true freedom includes the discipline to use it well, and that sometimes collaborative freedom serves better than solo independence.`,
        
        genius: `Their genius flashes through in moments of crisis or opportunity requiring immediate action. They're brilliant at seeing what needs to happen NOW and making it happen before others have processed the situation.

They have revolutionary instinct - an ability to sense when systems are ready to break, when people are ready for change, when the moment for action has arrived. They strike when the iron is hot.

Their insights often come through action rather than contemplation. They discover truth by doing, understand by experiencing, learn by pioneering.`,
        
        generational: `As a generational influence (Uranus spends about 7 years per sign), Uranus in Aries marks periods of revolutionary change in leadership, individual rights, and pioneering ventures. Wars often begin or end, new nations are born, individual expression surges.

On the personal level, it creates a generation of natural rebels and pioneers who challenge existing authority and create new models of leadership and independence.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, they need partners who honor their autonomy and may even share their revolutionary spirit. They're attracted to unusual, exciting, non-traditional partnerships.

The growth edge is learning that true partnership can enhance freedom rather than limit it, and that revolutionary change includes relating in new ways, not just acting alone.

They may pioneer new relationship models - open relationships, living apart together, collaborative entrepreneurship as romantic partnership, or entirely new forms they invent.`,
        
        lifeWork: `Their life work involves pioneering, leadership in innovative fields, activism, or any area where they can be first and free. Entrepreneurship, revolutionary movements, extreme sports, or cutting-edge technology serves them.

They're here to show others that freedom is possible, that you can break from tradition and survive (even thrive), that new ways of being are available to those brave enough to try them.

The most fulfilling path is one where they're constantly breaking new ground, leading others into unexplored territory, and living proof that liberation works.`,
        
        shadowWork: `The shadow is recklessness, destructive rebellion, and change for change's sake. They may break things just to prove they can, rebel without purpose, or be so focused on freedom that they can't create anything lasting.

There can be violence (physical or emotional) when their freedom is threatened. Learning to channel revolutionary energy constructively is essential.

The deeper shadow is isolation - being so independent and unusual that they can't connect, so focused on breaking free that they never build anything, so committed to being first that they're always alone.`,
        
        spiritualMeaning: `Spiritually, Uranus in Aries represents the soul who incarnated to demonstrate that immediate liberation is possible. They're here to show that awakening can happen in an instant, that freedom doesn't require preparation, that breakthrough is one courageous choice away.

Their spiritual gift is catalyzing others' awakening through their example. When people see them living freely, acting boldly, breaking through limitations, it triggers their own revolutionary spirit.

The ultimate expression is the spiritual warrior who fights for collective liberation by living their own freedom so completely that it inspires revolution in all who witness it.`,
        
        affirmation: "I am lightning strike of change. My courage pioneers new possibilities. I break through limitations and inspire others to freedom. My revolutionary spirit serves human liberation."
    },

    Taurus: {
        title: "Uranus in Taurus - Revolutionary Abundance",
        archetype: "The Wealth Revolutionary",
        hook: "With Uranus in Taurus, this soul carries revolutionary relationship with resources, value, and embodiment. They are here to transform how humanity relates to earth, money, and material security.",
        
        coreExpression: `Uranus in Taurus creates the revolutionary builder - someone who innovates in the material realm, who finds new ways to create security, who disrupts economic systems while creating stable alternatives.

This placement combines Uranian breakthrough with Taurean groundedness. They don't just theorize about new economic models - they build them. They don't just rebel against materialism - they create new relationships with matter.

Their gift is capacity to revolutionize the stable, to bring innovation to what's traditionally slow, to transform relationship with earth and resources while maintaining groundedness.`,
        
        innovation: `Their innovation is material and practical. They invent new currencies, new farming methods, new sustainable technologies, new ways of relating to earth's resources, new financial systems, or new forms of security.

They may pioneer cryptocurrency, regenerative agriculture, alternative economics, sustainable architecture, or entirely new relationships with body and earth.

The key is that their innovations are grounded and functional. They create revolutions that work practically, that sustain themselves, that transform how we live on earth.`,
        
        rebellion: `Their rebellion is against economic injustice, environmental destruction, and systems that make security inaccessible. They refuse to accept that some must struggle while others hoard.

But their rebellion creates alternatives. They build new systems, demonstrate new possibilities, create working models of revolutionary economics. Their protest is constructive.

The most powerful expression is revolutionizing wealth distribution not through destruction but through creating abundance systems that naturally serve everyone.`,
        
        freedom: `Freedom for them is economic and physical. They need financial sovereignty - the ability to create security without being trapped in traditional systems. They need bodily autonomy.

Their freedom quest may involve creating alternative income streams, building self-sufficient homesteads, or developing new technologies that liberate from economic dependence.

The challenge is that sudden changes in finance can be destabilizing. Learning to bring revolutionary vision to economic life while maintaining security is their journey.`,
        
        genius: `Their genius is in seeing how to create stable abundance through innovative means. They understand how to make revolutionary ideas work practically, how to sustain change, how to build security differently.

They have revolutionary instinct about resources - knowing when systems are ready to transform, when new technologies can replace old, when humanity is ready for new economic models.

Their insights often combine ecological wisdom with technological innovation - finding ways to live on earth that are both ancient and futuristic.`,
        
        generational: `As generational influence, Uranus in Taurus marks periods of revolutionary change in economics, agriculture, ecology, and relationship with earth. Financial systems transform, new currencies emerge, environmental consciousness shifts.

On the personal level, it creates a generation who pioneers new relationship with resources, body, and earth - finding ways to live sustainably and abundantly.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, they need partners who share their values about resources and earth, who don't need traditional markers of security to feel safe. They're attracted to unusual but stable partnerships.

The growth edge is learning that intimacy itself is revolutionary, that sharing resources deeply can be freedom, that stable partnership can enhance rather than limit autonomy.

They may pioneer new models of economic partnership - collaborative businesses, shared resources with clear boundaries, or entirely new ways of building wealth together.`,
        
        lifeWork: `Their life work involves revolutionary building - sustainable technology, alternative economics, regenerative agriculture, body-based healing, or any field where they can transform material reality.

They're here to show that security doesn't require traditional systems, that abundance can be created sustainably, that relationship with earth and resources can be both revolutionary and grounding.

The most fulfilling path is one where they're building tangible alternatives to broken systems, demonstrating new possibilities that others can replicate and adapt.`,
        
        shadowWork: `The shadow is stubborn attachment to their revolutionary ways, or conversely, sudden destabilization of security through reckless change. They may cling to alternative systems that aren't working or destroy stability in pursuit of freedom.

Financial upheaval can be constant if they can't ground their revolutionary energy. Learning to change steadily rather than explosively serves them.

The deeper shadow is materialism disguised as revolution - hoarding alternative currencies, building sustainable empires that serve ego, or using environmental consciousness as status rather than genuine care.`,
        
        spiritualMeaning: `Spiritually, Uranus in Taurus represents souls who incarnated to heal humanity's relationship with earth and embody revolutionary sustainability. They're here to show that material and spiritual aren't separate.

Their spiritual gift is demonstrating that awakening includes body and earth, that liberation includes economic justice, that enlightenment can be grounded and practical.

The ultimate expression is the spiritual revolutionary who transforms material reality, creating heaven on earth not as concept but as lived experience available to all.`,
        
        affirmation: "I revolutionize relationship with resources. My innovations create sustainable abundance. I build new systems that serve earth and all beings. My revolutionary vision is grounded and practical."

const DEEP_NEPTUNE_READINGS = {
    Aries: {
        title: "Neptune in Aries - Spiritual Warrior",
        archetype: "The Divine Action",
        hook: "With Neptune in Aries, this soul dissolves boundaries around action and leadership. They are here to spiritualize initiative, to make courage compassionate, to bring divine inspiration to pioneering.",
        
        dreamVision: `Neptune in Aries dreams of spiritual warriorhood - action taken in service of the divine, leadership that uplifts all beings, courage infused with compassion. They envision a world where everyone is empowered.

Their visions often involve collective action for spiritual purposes - spiritual activism, compassionate leadership movements, or inspired initiatives that serve universal love.

The gift is capacity to inspire action not from ego but from divine connection, to lead not for personal glory but for spiritual evolution.`,
        
        dissolution: `Neptune dissolves the boundaries of ego in action. These souls may struggle with taking personal credit, knowing when action is theirs versus divine inspiration working through them.

They may also dissolve traditional concepts of leadership, creating more fluid, inspired, spiritual forms of being first and initiating. Hierarchical authority feels false.

The challenge is not dissolving so completely that they can't act at all - learning that divine inspiration requires embodied action, that spiritual vision needs human warriorhood to manifest.`,
        
        spiritualGift: `Their spiritual gift is inspired action - the capacity to move when spirit calls, to lead from divine connection, to be spiritual pioneers. They channel universal creative force into immediate manifestation.

They teach that action can be prayer, that courage can be devotion, that leadership can be service to the divine. They spiritualize the warrior archetype.

The most powerful expression is the mystic warrior who acts from such deep spiritual connection that their every move serves awakening, whose courage inspires divine remembrance in all who witness it.`,
        
        illusion: `The illusion is believing they are the source of action rather than channel for divine will. Or conversely, believing so completely in divine action that their human will disappears.

They may also fall into spiritual bypassing of healthy anger and boundaries, believing compassion means never asserting or protecting. Learning that spiritual warriorhood includes fierce love is crucial.

The shadow is also passive waiting for divine instruction when divine will is already flowing - missing that they ARE the divine in action.`,
        
        compassion: `Their compassion is active and immediate. When they see suffering, they move to address it. Their empathy triggers not just feeling but doing.

They have capacity to hold both strength and tenderness, to be fierce protectors whose ferocity comes from love. They demonstrate that compassion can be warrior energy.

The growth edge is learning that sometimes compassion means boundaries, that helping everyone immediately can deplete them, that spiritual action requires sustainable energy.`,
        
        creativity: `Their creativity is spontaneous and inspired. Art, music, movement - all flow through them when they surrender to divine creativity. They create in the moment, channeling rather than planning.

They may pioneer new forms of spiritual practice that are active and immediate - ecstatic dance, walking meditation, martial arts as spiritual path, or inspired action as art form.

The key is trusting what flows through rather than trying to control creative expression. Their art is prayer in motion.`,
        
        generational: `As generational influence (Neptune spends ~14 years per sign), Neptune in Aries marks periods when spirituality becomes active, when mysticism meets warriorhood, when divine inspiration flows through pioneering ventures.

On personal level, it creates souls who feel called to spiritual activism, inspired leadership, compassionate courage - those who will fight for universal love.`,
        
        healingPath: `Their healing path is through sacred action - moving meditation, yoga, martial arts, or any practice that integrates spiritual connection with physical expression. Stillness alone doesn't serve them.

They heal by doing what inspires them, by following divine impulses to act, by allowing spirit to move through their body. Action is their meditation.

The most healing practice is learning to discern divine inspiration from ego impulse, then courageously acting on true spiritual guidance.`,
        
        spiritualLesson: `The spiritual lesson is that divine will requires human action to manifest. Spirit needs warriors. The universe moves through those brave enough to act while surrendered to something greater.

They're learning that being first, being courageous, being a leader can all be spiritual service when done from connection to divine source. Action itself can be enlightenment.`,
        
        affirmation: "I am divine action. Spirit moves through my courage. My leadership serves universal love. I am spiritual warrior, acting from infinite compassion."

const DEEP_PLUTO_READINGS = {
    Aries: {
        title: "Pluto in Aries - Power Reclaimed",
        archetype: "The Death and Rebirth of Self",
        hook: "With Pluto in Aries, this soul transforms through discovering authentic power and releasing false identities. They are here to die and be reborn repeatedly, each time more truly themselves.",
        
        transformation: `Pluto in Aries transforms the very concept of self. These souls experience death and rebirth of identity, sometimes many times in one lifetime. Each crisis strips away false self and reveals true essence.

They transform through claiming power, through discovering what they're truly capable of when pushed to limits, through learning that they can survive anything.

Their gift is capacity to reinvent themselves completely, to rise from ashes stronger, to transform weakness into unprecedented strength. They are phoenixes.`,
        
        power: `Their power is personal and immediate. They have capacity for immense will, tremendous courage, and ability to accomplish what seems impossible through sheer determined force.

But they must learn difference between authentic power (self-mastery) and false power (domination). Their journey involves discovering real strength versus compensatory aggression.

The most powerful expression is someone who has faced their own powerlessness completely and transformed it into compassionate strength - power that uplifts rather than dominates.`,
        
        shadow: `Their shadow is rage, violence, and domination. When they feel powerless, they may become tyrants. When wounded, they may wound others. The Mars-Pluto combination can be explosive.

They have capacity for destruction - of themselves and others. Learning to channel plutonic intensity constructively rather than destructively is life work.

The deeper shadow is hidden powerlessness - appearing strong while feeling weak inside, dominating others to avoid own vulnerability, creating crises to feel in control.`,
        
        obsession: `They can become obsessed with strength, achievement, being first, or proving themselves. The drive to be powerful can consume everything else.

Or they obsess about their wounds, their powerlessness, revenge against those who hurt them. The intensity doesn't have middle ground until they learn balance.

The key is recognizing obsession as sign of transformation trying to happen - where they're obsessed is where they need to die and be reborn.`,
        
        crisis: `Crisis is their catalyst. Each emergency, each threat to survival, each moment of powerlessness becomes opportunity for transformation. They need pressure to reveal their power.

They may unconsciously create crises to force their own evolution. Learning to transform without trauma becomes mature expression of this placement.

The gift is that in any crisis, they have access to reserves of strength others don't. When everything is on the line, they discover they're capable of anything.`,
        
        rebirth: `Each rebirth makes them more authentic. False identities burn away in successive crises until what remains is indestructible essence. They become increasingly real.

The phoenix process can be exhausting - they may wish they could just be stable. But their soul chose transformation through identity death and rebirth.

The mature expression is someone who has died and been reborn so many times they no longer fear change, who is so deeply themselves that nothing external can threaten them.`,
        
        generational: `As generational influence (Pluto spends ~20 years per sign), Pluto in Aries marks periods of massive transformation in individual power, leadership, warfare, and human will.

On personal level, it creates souls who will transform humanity's relationship with power, leadership, and individualism - often through their own intense journey of death and rebirth.`,
        
        relationships: `In relationships, they need partners who can handle intensity, who aren't threatened by their power, who can witness their transformation without trying to stop it.

Power struggles can be constant until they learn that true intimacy requires vulnerability, that real power means not needing to dominate.

The evolved expression is bringing transformative intensity to relationship - creating partnerships so honest, so deep, so real that both people are constantly being reborn through the connection.`,
        
        lifeWork: `Their life work involves transformation of self and potentially transforming others through their example. Crisis intervention, extreme environments, psychology, or leadership in intense fields serves them.

They're here to demonstrate that human will is more powerful than circumstances, that you can overcome anything, that rebirth from seeming death is possible.

The most fulfilling path is one where they're constantly being challenged to discover new depths of power, where their intensity serves others' transformation.`,
        
        shadowIntegration: `Shadow work is essential and ongoing. They must face their capacity for destruction, their hunger for power, their rage at powerlessness. Denying shadow makes it dangerous.

The work is befriending the destroyer, understanding that death serves rebirth, that acknowledging their power (including its dark expressions) allows conscious choice.

Integration means becoming someone who has such intimate relationship with their shadow that it becomes ally rather than enemy - the warrior who knows their dark side and consciously chooses light.`,
        
        spiritualMeaning: `Spiritually, Pluto in Aries represents souls who incarnated to transform human understanding of power and self. They're here to show that authentic power comes from within, that identity is fluid, that death is gateway to rebirth.

Their spiritual gift is demonstrating that you can lose everything and not only survive but become stronger. They teach that true self is indestructible.

The ultimate expression is the spiritual warrior who has died and been reborn so many times they embody eternal phoenix - showing humanity that transformation is our true nature.`,
        
        affirmation: "I embrace my power fully. I die and am reborn with each breath. My strength comes from facing my shadow. I transform myself and inspire transformation in others."
