## Acknowledgments

This project evolved through multiple strategic pivots based on user feedback and insights. Each phase added depth and value to the platform.

**Core Question that drove Phase 13 expansion:**
"This blueprint is you at your moment of birth, so why wouldn't you explore that? What else could they generate with AI for free to make the reading easier to absorb as an experience?"

This question transformed the entire approach from visual art only to a comprehensive experiential ecosystem.
