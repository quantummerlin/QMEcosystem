# Infographic Creation Guide
## Transforming Soul Blueprint Readings into Visual Data Stories

> **Why Infographics Matter**: Your brain processes visual information 60,000x faster than text. Infographics make complex soul blueprint data instantly understandable, highly shareable, and perfect for AdSense engagement (users linger, explore, and share).

---

## 🎯 The Ultimate Question: How Many Infographics?

### The Short Answer:
**15-20 infographics** cover 90% of what users want to see.

### The Strategic Answer:
**Three-Tier Approach** (scalable, prioritized, revenue-optimized):

| Tier | Number | Focus | AdSense Impact | Priority |
|------|--------|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | 5-7 | Core Identity | High | ⭐⭐⭐ Critical |
| **Tier 2** | 5-7 | Life Areas | High | ⭐⭐ High |
| **Tier 3** | 5-6 | Deep Dive | Medium | ⭐ Medium |

### Why 15-20 Infographics (Not 100)?

**Psychological Reality**:
- Users don't want 100 infographics (overwhelming)
- They want 10-15 key insights visualized
- They want to share the "big picture," not every detail
- Quality > Quantity (5 amazing infographics > 20 mediocre ones)

**AdSense Optimization**:
- 5-7 infographics = 30-45 page views per user (to view all)
- Each infographic page = 4 ads × 30-45 views = 120-180 ad impressions
- Users share infographics → viral traffic → more impressions
- Better engagement with fewer, higher-quality visuals

**User Journey Reality**:
1. User gets reading → **copies core readings** (Tier 1 infographics)
2. User gets excited → **explores life areas** (Tier 2 infographics)
3. User becomes fan → **deep dives** (Tier 3 infographics)
4. User shares → **shows off Tier 1-2 infographics**
