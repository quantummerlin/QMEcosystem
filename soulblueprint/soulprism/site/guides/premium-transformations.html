                            <pre>I want you to write a full-length autobiography (60,000–80,000 words) based entirely on my soul blueprint data. This is "The Pattern Memoir" — my life story told through the lens of my cosmic design.

Here is my complete soul blueprint reading:

[PASTE YOUR FULL READING HERE]

Structure the book as follows:
- Prologue: The moment of my birth and what the sky said
- Part 1 (Chapters 1-5): Childhood & Foundation (Moon, IC, 4th house patterns)
- Part 2 (Chapters 6-10): Identity & Becoming (Sun, Rising, Saturn first cycle)
- Part 3 (Chapters 11-15): Love & Connection (Venus, 7th house, Juno, Lilith)
- Part 4 (Chapters 16-20): Purpose & Career (Midheaven, 10th house, North Node)
- Part 5 (Chapters 21-25): Transformation & Power (Pluto, 8th house, Chiron)
- Epilogue: The pattern continues — what comes next

Write in first person, literary memoir style. Each chapter should be 2,500–3,500 words. Include specific cosmic references woven naturally into the narrative. Make it feel like a real memoir, not an astrology textbook.

Start with the Prologue and Chapter 1. I'll ask you to continue chapter by chapter.</pre>

Structure:
