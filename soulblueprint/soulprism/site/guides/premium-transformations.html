                            <pre>I want you to write a full-length autobiography (60,000–80,000 words) based entirely on my soul blueprint data. This is "The Pattern Memoir" — my life story told through the lens of my cosmic design.

Here is my complete soul blueprint reading:

[PASTE YOUR FULL READING HERE]

Structure the book as follows:
- Prologue: The moment of my birth and what the sky said
- Part 1 (Chapters 1-5): Childhood & Foundation (Moon, IC, 4th house patterns)
- Part 2 (Chapters 6-10): Identity & Becoming (Sun, Rising, Saturn first cycle)
- Part 3 (Chapters 11-15): Love & Connection (Venus, 7th house, Juno, Lilith)
- Part 4 (Chapters 16-20): Purpose & Career (Midheaven, 10th house, North Node)
- Part 5 (Chapters 21-25): Transformation & Power (Pluto, 8th house, Chiron)
- Epilogue: The pattern continues — what comes next

Write in first person, literary memoir style. Each chapter should be 2,500–3,500 words. Include specific cosmic references woven naturally into the narrative. Make it feel like a real memoir, not an astrology textbook.

Start with the Prologue and Chapter 1. I'll ask you to continue chapter by chapter.</pre>

Here is my complete soul blueprint reading:

[PASTE YOUR FULL READING HERE]

Structure:
- ACT 1 (pages 1-30): Setup — Introduce the protagonist whose personality mirrors my Sun/Moon/Rising. Establish the world through my house placements. The inciting incident comes from my North Node calling.

- ACT 2B (pages 60-90): Complications — Chiron wound becomes the central obstacle. Lilith energy creates temptation or shadow confrontation. Pluto transformation begins.
- ACT 3 (pages 90-120): Resolution — North Node destiny is embraced. Chiron wound becomes the healing gift. Final image reflects the integrated blueprint.

Genre: [DRAMA/SCI-FI/FANTASY/THRILLER — choose based on dominant element]
Tone: [Based on my blueprint's dominant energy]

                            <li><strong>Limited context window</strong> — forgets earlier content in long projects</li>
                            <li><strong>Loses coherence</strong> — characters change, tone shifts, plot holes appear</li>
                            <li><strong>Shorter outputs</strong> — can't sustain 80,000-word manuscripts</li>
                            <li><strong>Basic image quality</strong> — less detail, less consistency</li>
