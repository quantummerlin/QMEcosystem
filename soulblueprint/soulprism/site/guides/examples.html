                    <h3>What This Demonstrates</h3>
                    <p><strong>1. Consistency:</strong> All images maintain the same ethereal, spiritual style</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Evolution:</strong> Colors add naturally, each image builds on previous ones</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Connection:</strong> Later images reference and connect to earlier ones</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Integration:</strong> By Image 10, all elements flow together</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Story:</strong> The progression tells Sarah's soul story, not just shows readings</p>

                <h2>🎯 YOUR TURN</h2>
                <p>Replace Sarah's information with your own:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your birth date</li>
                    <li>Your signs</li>
                    <li>Your numbers</li>
                    <li>Your placements</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Follow the same pattern:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with Sun</li>
                    <li>Continue with Moon</li>
                    <li>Add Rising</li>
                    <li>Add Life Path</li>
                    <li>Add North Node</li>
                    <li>Continue with planets, houses, aspects</li>
                    <li>Create comparative images</li>
                </ol>

                <blockquote>Your visual soul blueprint will be unique to you. Your colors will be different. Your symbols will be different. Your story will be different. But the process is the same. And the result? Seeing yourself clearly. For the first time.</blockquote>
