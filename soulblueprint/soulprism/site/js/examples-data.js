'visual-portrait': `A luminous figure stands at the center of swirling cosmic gold, their silhouette framed by a mane of solar light. Behind them, the constellation Leo burns bright against a deep indigo sky. A crown of sunflowers and golden laurels rests on their head, while their eyes — warm amber — hold both confidence and quiet knowing. Subtle lion imagery weaves through their flowing robes: paw prints in the fabric, a tail-like sash trailing behind. The entire portrait radiates warmth, as if the figure themselves are a source of light.

At the edges, silver moonlight intrudes — a reminder of the Scorpio depths beneath the golden surface. The background transitions from warm gold at center to deep blue-violet at the borders, capturing the tension between radiance and mystery.`,

'visual-scene': `A throne room made of crystallized sunlight stretches into infinity. Pillars of amber and gold frame a central pool of silver water — Scorpio's emotional depths meeting Leo's radiance. A figure sits not on the throne but beside the pool, one hand trailing in the water while the other reaches toward the vaulted ceiling where stars are being born.

Through tall arched windows, a Sagittarian landscape unfolds: mountains, open roads, distant horizons painted in sunset hues. The number 7 appears subtly in the architecture — seven pillars, seven stars reflected in the pool. The atmosphere feels both regal and intimate, public and deeply private.`,

'visual-abstract': `Sweeping strokes of molten gold collide with deep obsidian pools across the canvas. The upper third pulses with warm, expanding energy — circular forms radiating outward like solar flares. The lower third plunges into layered depths of midnight blue and violet, where hidden forms suggest transformation in progress.

Where these two zones meet, a dynamic tension line crackles with amber and crimson. Seven geometric shapes float along this boundary — diamonds, circles, spirals — each catching different light. The overall composition evokes Rothko's color fields but with an undercurrent of cosmic movement. Nothing is still. Everything is becoming.`,

'visual-symbolic': `At the center: a golden sun disk overlapping a silver crescent moon, forming an eclipse. From the eclipse, seven rays extend outward — each holding a different symbol: a lion (identity), a phoenix (transformation), an archer's arrow (direction), a winding path (journey), a flame (courage), a shield (protection), and an open book (wisdom).

Sacred geometry frames the composition: overlapping circles form a Flower of Life pattern. The color palette moves from warm gold at the center to deep purple at the edges. A subtle Aries ram appears at the top, pointing forward — the North Node's direction.`,

'visual-infographic': `SOUL BLUEPRINT OVERVIEW — A clean, modern layout with a cosmic gradient background. The header features the name in elegant serif type. Below, five circular icons represent the Big Five placements: Sun (Leo, gold), Moon (Scorpio, silver), Rising (Sagittarius, purple), Life Path (7, blue), North Node (Aries, red).

A horizontal bar shows elemental distribution: 42% Fire, 28% Water, 18% Earth, 12% Air. At the bottom, three key themes are highlighted in card format: Creative Leadership, Emotional Depth, Spiritual Seeking. Color palette: gold, silver, indigo, crimson.`,

'story-hero': `THE HERO'S JOURNEY

Chapter 1: The Ordinary World
Sarah lived in a world of quiet expectations. On the surface, she shone — confident, creative, the one everyone noticed in a room. But beneath that golden exterior, a Scorpionic ocean churned with questions no one else seemed to ask. Who am I really? What lies beneath the performance?

Chapter 2: The Call to Adventure
It arrived not as a dramatic event, but as a persistent whisper. Life Path 7 began to speak: there's more than what you can see. A book fell off a shelf. A stranger said something that echoed for weeks. The universe was tapping her shoulder.

Chapter 3: Refusal of the Call
Her South Node in Libra resisted. Stay comfortable. Keep the peace. Don't rock the boat. But the Leo Sun couldn't ignore the fire building inside, and the Scorpio Moon couldn't pretend the depths didn't exist…`,

'story-fairy': `Once upon a time, in a kingdom where the sun never quite set, there lived a girl named Sarah whose hair caught light like spun gold.

She was born with two gifts and one secret.

Her first gift was Radiance — everywhere she went, people turned to look. Not because she demanded it, but because she glowed from within, like a lantern in a dim room. This was the blessing of her Leo heart.

Her second gift was Sight — she could look at anyone and know what they were hiding. Not their secrets exactly, but their feelings. The sadness behind a smile. The fear beneath the bravado. This was the blessing — and the burden — of her Scorpio soul.

Her secret? She didn't know which gift was truly hers. Was she the golden girl who lit up every room? Or the dark-eyed seer who understood too much?

The answer, of course, was both. But it would take an entire journey to discover that…`,

'story-myth': `In the age before memory, when the gods still walked among mortals, there was born a child of two celestial parents: Helios, lord of the blazing sun, and Selene, keeper of the hidden moon.

The child was named Sarathiel, and she carried within her a paradox that troubled even the gods. By day, she burned with her father's fire — bold, magnificent, commanding the attention of every living thing. By night, she dove into her mother's silver waters, where emotions ran deeper than any ocean.

"Choose," said the elder gods at the Council of Stars. "You cannot be both fire and water. It is not the way."

But Sarathiel, with the arrow of Sagittarius in her hand and the wisdom of the Seventh Path illuminating her mind, looked at the council and spoke: "Then I will make a new way."`,

'story-future': `Dear Sarah,

I'm writing this from the sunlit study of our home in the hills. You're 44 now. I know — the 24-year-old reading this can't imagine it. But listen.

You followed the fire. That Aries North Node? You finally stopped asking permission and started DOING. At 29, you left the job that looked good on paper but felt like a slow death. Everyone thought you were crazy. The Libra South Node screamed at you to go back, to play it safe.

You didn't.

By 32, you'd built something that was entirely YOURS. Not a compromise. Not what someone else wanted for you. The Leo Sun finally had a stage that matched its magnitude. The Scorpio Moon had depth to explore. The Sagittarius Rising had horizons to chase.

The secret nobody tells you about following your blueprint? It doesn't get easier. It gets more YOU. And that, it turns out, is everything.`,

'story-past': `In 15th-century Florence, there lived an artist known only as La Leonessa — the Lioness.

History records little about her real name, only that she painted with a ferocity that unsettled the established masters. Her canvases burned with gold leaf and hidden symbols that only the initiated could read.

This was Sarah's South Node life — the Libra incarnation that learned to create beauty through partnership and compromise, but secretly harbored a fire that demanded more.

La Leonessa kept a journal in invisible ink. In it, she wrote: "They see the paintings. They do not see the painter. I am more than my reflection in their eyes."

This was the seed of the Aries North Node beginning to stir — the soul's first whisper that the next lifetime would require courage, not collaboration.`,

'story-character': `THE ARCHETYPES OF SARAH

1. The Radiant Sovereign (Leo Sun)
The dominant archetype. The golden leader who commands attention not through force but through authentic self-expression. Fictional parallel: Daenerys Targaryen before the dragons — the quiet certainty that she was meant for something extraordinary.

2. The Shadow Seer (Scorpio Moon)
The part that sees what others miss. Emotional intelligence so acute it borders on psychic. Fictional parallel: Luna Lovegood — dismissed as strange, but seeing truths invisible to everyone else.

3. The Wandering Philosopher (Sagittarius Rising)
The face shown to the world: open, adventurous, always ready for the next horizon. Fictional parallel: Elizabeth Bennet — witty, independent, refusing to be contained.

4. The Sacred Seeker (Life Path 7)
The quiet hunger for meaning that drives everything. Never satisfied with surface explanations. Fictional parallel: Dr. Strange — a brilliant mind seeking ultimate truth.`,

'story-autobiography': `I was born on the hottest day of August, and my mother said even the nurses commented on how I came out looking around — not crying, just looking, like I was assessing the situation.

That's the most Scorpio Moon thing I've ever heard about myself.

But the Leo Sun had its say too. By age three, I was performing. Not for an audience, exactly — more for myself. I'd stand on the coffee table and narrate stories to invisible crowds. I'd dress up in everything gold I could find. I needed to be seen, even when no one was watching.

The tension between those two drives — the need to shine and the need to hide — would define the first thirty years of my life. The Sagittarius Rising kept me moving, kept me from staying stuck in either extreme for too long. It whispered: there's more out there. Go find it.`,

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   LANGUAGE TRANSFORMS
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

'language-mystical': `In the celestial dance of your becoming, the great Sun chose to plant its golden seed within the sign of the Lion. You are fire made flesh, radiance given form. Your heart beats with the ancient rhythm of sovereignty — not the sovereignty of conquest, but the sovereignty of being so fully, so unapologetically yourself that others cannot help but orbit your warmth.

Yet beneath this golden surface, the Moon speaks a different tongue. She placed herself in Scorpio's depths — the still, dark waters where truth lives unadorned. Here, in your emotional underworld, you are not the lion but the phoenix. You do not simply feel — you transmute. Every wound becomes wisdom. Every shadow becomes sight.`,

'language-clinical': `Subject presents with a Sun-Leo configuration indicating dominant traits associated with the extraversion dimension of the Big Five personality model (high extraversion, moderate openness). The need for recognition and creative self-expression aligns with Maslow's esteem needs and suggests a personality oriented toward self-actualization through visible achievement.

The Moon-Scorpio placement introduces a complex secondary pattern: high emotional intensity with a preference for controlled expression (consistent with avoidant attachment tendencies under stress). This creates an internal tension between the Sun's desire for visibility and the Moon's need for emotional privacy — a dynamic psychodynamically consistent with a false-self/true-self split.`,

'language-casual': `OK so here's the deal with your chart — you're basically a Leo Sun, which means you've got that natural "main character energy." People notice you when you walk in a room and you probably can't explain why. It's not that you're loud or anything, it's more like… you glow? Like a human ring light.

But here's where it gets interesting: your Moon is in Scorpio. So on the inside? You're like an emotional detective. You feel EVERYTHING and you see through people's masks like they're made of cling wrap. Your friends probably come to you with their deep stuff because somehow you just GET it.

And your Rising is Sagittarius, which means your vibe when people first meet you is like "hey let's go on an adventure and also discuss the meaning of life."`,

'language-poetic': `You were born beneath the lion's star,
a golden child with ancient scars
hidden well beneath the mane —
your Scorpio moon, your private rain.

The sun says: Shine. Command the room.
The moon says: Feel. Embrace the gloom.
Between these fires, light and deep,
you are the promise both worlds keep.

Sagittarius rising sets your face
toward some far, uncharted place —
the archer's arrow, loosed and free,
aimed at who you're meant to be.`,

'language-scientific': `From a psychological perspective, this birth chart configuration presents a compelling case study in personality dynamics. The Leo Sun placement correlates with elevated scores on the Big Five's Extraversion and Openness dimensions (Costa & McCrae, 1992), consistent with research linking fire-sign dominance to approach-motivated behavior (Eysenck, 1967).

The Scorpio Moon introduces a counterbalancing dynamic. Research on emotional intelligence (Goleman, 1995) suggests this placement corresponds to heightened intrapersonal awareness — the capacity for deep self-monitoring and emotional pattern recognition. The Sun-Moon square aspect creates what Jungian analysts describe as a "creative tension" between persona (Leo) and anima/shadow (Scorpio).`,

'language-reading-level': `SIMPLE (8th Grade):
You're a Leo Sun, which means you're naturally confident and creative. People are drawn to your warmth and energy. You love to express yourself and be noticed for your unique talents. Your Moon in Scorpio means your feelings run very deep — much deeper than people realize.

STANDARD (College):
Your Leo Sun placement positions you as a natural leader driven by creative self-expression and authentic presence. The tension between your outward radiance and your Scorpio Moon's emotional intensity creates a rich inner landscape that fuels both your greatest strengths and your most significant growth edges.

ADVANCED (Academic):
The Sun-Leo configuration presents a complex interplay between archetypal solar consciousness and the individual's ego-identity formation. When contextualized within the broader chart framework — particularly the Scorpio lunar placement — we observe a dialectical tension between Jungian persona development and shadow integration.`,

'language-perspective': `FIRST PERSON:
"I am fire and depth intertwined. My Leo Sun gives me the courage to stand center-stage, to express the fullness of who I am without apology. My Scorpio Moon gives me the wisdom to understand that beneath every surface lies something more true."

SECOND PERSON:
"You carry a rare combination — the lion's bold radiance and the scorpion's penetrating insight. You shine in rooms, but your real power lives in the depths you explore when no one is watching."

THIRD PERSON:
"Sarah possesses an unusual duality. Outwardly, she projects the warmth and confidence characteristic of Leo — charismatic, creative, naturally commanding attention. Privately, her Scorpio Moon drives an emotional intensity that few ever witness."

UNIVERSAL:
"One who carries the Sun in Leo and Moon in Scorpio walks between two kingdoms — the kingdom of light, where all is visible and celebrated, and the kingdom of depth, where truth is found in darkness."`,

   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

'practical-daily': `YOUR SOUL-ALIGNED DAILY ROUTINE

6:30 AM — Lion's Wake (Sun in Leo)
Rise with the sun. Stand in natural light for 2 minutes. Set one creative intention: "Today I will express my authentic self through ____."

7:00 AM — Scorpio Moon Check-In
Before checking your phone, sit with one feeling. Name it. Don't fix it. This honors your Moon's need for emotional honesty.

9:00 AM — Peak Creative Window
Your Leo Sun is strongest here. Block 2 hours for your most important creative or leadership work. No meetings. No email. Pure expression.

12:00 PM — Sagittarius Expansion Break
Take a walk. Change your environment. Your Rising sign needs movement and new input. Listen to a podcast. Feed the archer's curiosity.

6:00 PM — Mars in Cancer Nurturing
Cook a meal. Call someone you love. Your Mars finds energy through caregiving and home-based activity.

9:00 PM — Moon Reflection
Journal for 10 minutes. Let the Scorpio Moon process the day's emotional data. No judgment. Just observation.`,

'practical-career': `CAREER GUIDANCE

IDEAL MATCHES (90%+ alignment):

1. Creative Director / Art Director — Leo Sun thrives in visible creative leadership. Scorpio Moon adds strategic depth. Mercury Virgo ensures quality execution.

2. Therapist / Counsellor — Scorpio Moon's emotional intelligence + Leo Sun's warmth = powerful therapeutic presence. Life Path 7 supports the seeker's calling.

3. Independent Entrepreneur — North Node Aries demands self-direction. Leo Sun needs creative ownership. Sagittarius Rising can't tolerate being boxed in.

ENVIRONMENTS WHERE YOU THRIVE:
• Small, passionate teams (not large bureaucracies)
• Creative freedom with visible impact
• Leadership roles where you set the vision

WARNING SIGNS OF MISALIGNMENT:
• You're performing someone else's vision (Leo Sun withers)
• There's no emotional depth in the work (Scorpio Moon starves)
• You can't grow, travel, or learn (Sagittarius Rising suffocates)`,

'practical-relationships': `RELATIONSHIP INSIGHTS

WHAT YOU NEED IN A PARTNER:
• Someone who sees past your Leo performance to the Scorpio depth underneath
• Emotional honesty (you can sense dishonesty instantly)
• Intellectual stimulation (Sagittarius Rising demands it)
• Space for both togetherness and solitary processing

YOUR LOVE LANGUAGE:
Primary: Words of Affirmation (Leo Sun needs to hear "you're amazing")
Secondary: Quality Time (Scorpio Moon needs depth, not surface)
Shadow: Acts of Service (Mars in Cancer secretly wants to be taken care of)

PATTERN TO WATCH:
You attract partners who are drawn to your light (Leo) but intimidated by your depth (Scorpio). When they pull back from your intensity, you interpret it as rejection and either perform harder or withdraw completely. Growth comes from finding someone who loves BOTH the lion and the phoenix.`,

'practical-decision': `PERSONAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

When facing any major decision, run it through your blueprint filter:

STEP 1: LEO SUN CHECK
"Does this allow me to express my authentic creative self?"
If no → strong caution.

STEP 2: SCORPIO MOON CHECK
"Does this feel true in my gut, beneath the surface appeal?"
If your Moon says no but your ego says yes → the Moon is right. Always.

STEP 3: SAGITTARIUS RISING CHECK
"Does this expand my world or shrink it?"
If it shrinks → you'll eventually rebel, even if it looks good on paper.

STEP 4: LIFE PATH 7 CHECK
"Does this deepen my understanding of life/myself/truth?"
If purely material with no depth → it won't satisfy long-term.

STEP 5: NORTH NODE ARIES CHECK
"Am I choosing this for myself, or to please/accommodate others?"
If for others → South Node Libra pattern. Redirect to self.`,

'practical-wellness': `SOUL-ALIGNED WELLNESS PLAN

MOVEMENT (Mars in Cancer):
Your Mars doesn't respond to aggressive, competitive exercise. Instead: swimming, yoga, dance, walking in nature. Movement that feels nurturing, not punishing.

NUTRITION (Leo Sun + Scorpio Moon):
You thrive on warm, rich foods — not restrictive diets. Quality proteins, warming spices, golden-colored foods (turmeric, honey, saffron). Avoid eating while stressed — Scorpio Moon stores tension in the gut.

MENTAL HEALTH (Life Path 7):
Solitude is not depression — it's your operating system. You NEED quiet time. If you don't get it, your Scorpio Moon will create crises to force introspection.

STRESS SIGNALS:
• Leo Sun stressed: performing but feeling empty
• Scorpio Moon stressed: emotional shutdown, obsessive thinking
• Sagittarius Rising stressed: restlessness, escape fantasies`,

'practical-learning': `LEARNING STYLE PROFILE

PRIMARY STYLE: Visual-Conceptual (Life Path 7 + Mercury Virgo)
You learn best by seeing the big picture first, then drilling into details.

OPTIMAL STUDY ENVIRONMENT:
• Quiet, private space (Scorpio Moon + Life Path 7)
• Natural light (Leo Sun)
• Organized materials (Mercury Virgo)
• Freedom to go on tangents (Sagittarius Rising)

ATTENTION PATTERN:
Deep focus in 90-minute blocks, then needs variety. Can hyperfocus on emotionally engaging topics (Scorpio Moon), struggles with material that feels superficial.

BEST TIME FOR LEARNING:
Morning (9-11am) for new concepts. Evening (8-10pm) for deep reflection. Avoid afternoon dips (2-4pm).

NATURAL STRENGTHS:
Psychology, philosophy, creative arts, leadership, pattern recognition, emotional intelligence.`,

'practical-communication': `COMMUNICATION STYLE GUIDE

Warm, direct, and subtly commanding (Leo Sun + Mercury Virgo). You speak with authority even when you don't intend to. People listen — sometimes more than you realize.

STRENGTHS:
• Inspiring others through vivid, passionate language
• Reading the room and adjusting your message
• Communicating complex emotions with precision
• Storytelling — you make ideas come alive

BLIND SPOTS:
• Dominating conversations without realizing it (Leo Sun)
• Withholding real feelings while appearing open (Scorpio Moon)
• Bluntness that can hurt (Sagittarius Rising's honesty)

FOR DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS:
Lead with Scorpio Moon's empathy, not Leo Sun's pride. Ask questions before making statements. Let silence exist — your Sagittarius Rising wants to fill every gap, but sometimes silence is the bridge.`,

'practical-parenting': `PARENTING INSIGHTS

YOUR NATURAL STYLE:
Warm, protective, and encouraging (Leo Sun + Mars Cancer). You want your children to shine. You celebrate their uniqueness loudly and fiercely.

STRENGTHS:
• Unconditional support for your child's self-expression
• Deep emotional attunement (Scorpio Moon reads unspoken feelings)
• Making learning an adventure (Sagittarius Rising)
• Creating traditions and emotional security (Mars Cancer)

WATCH OUT FOR:
• Living through your children's achievements (Leo Sun shadow)
• Emotional intensity that overwhelms young children (Scorpio Moon)
• Overprotecting when they need independence (Mars Cancer)

AGE-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
Ages 0-7: Trust your Mars Cancer instincts. Nurture, protect, create rituals.
Ages 7-14: Let Leo Sun celebrate their emerging personality. Don't compare.
Ages 14-21: Sagittarius Rising wisdom — give freedom with guardrails.`,

'practical-travel': `SOUL-ALIGNED TRAVEL GUIDE

YOUR TRAVEL STYLE:
Adventurous but needs depth (Sagittarius Rising + Scorpio Moon). You're not a resort person. You want to FEEL a place — its history, its secrets, its soul.

TOP 5 DESTINATIONS:
1. Kyoto, Japan — Spiritual depth meets aesthetic beauty (Life Path 7 + Leo Sun)
2. Iceland — Raw, transformative landscapes (Scorpio Moon + Sagittarius Rising)

5. Edinburgh, Scotland — Ancient wisdom, storytelling culture (Life Path 7)

ENERGY ESSENTIALS:
• Journal (Scorpio Moon needs to process)
• Something gold or beautiful to wear (Leo Sun needs to feel radiant)
• A book on local philosophy (Life Path 7)
• Comfortable shoes (Sagittarius Rising will explore for hours)`,

'spiritual-meditation': `GUIDED MEDITATION: Meeting Your Inner Light

[Begin — speak slowly, warmly]

Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in through your nose… and release through your mouth. Again. Feel your body settle into stillness.

Now imagine a golden light forming at the center of your chest. This is your Leo Sun — your core essence, your creative fire. Watch it glow. Feel its warmth spreading through your body. You don't need to do anything. Just let it be what it is: your natural radiance.

[Pause 10 seconds]

Now let your awareness sink deeper. Below the golden light, there is water. Silver, still, deep. This is your Scorpio Moon — your emotional truth. Don't be afraid of it. The water is wise.

Let the golden light meet the silver water. Watch what happens where fire meets depth. Steam rises. This steam is your unique gift — the ability to shine AND see.

[3-minute silence for integration]

When you're ready, carry this image with you: golden light meeting silver water. This is who you are.`,

'creative-poetry': `THE LION AND THE WELL

I am the lion at the edge of the well,
golden-maned, warm-breathed,
casting my shadow over dark water
where another version of me lives.

She does not roar. She listens.
She does not command. She knows.

Where I burn bright enough
for everyone to see,
she sits in the depths
seeing everything.

We are not enemies,
the lion and the well-dweller.
We are the same creature
learning to breathe underwater
and burn in the air
at the same time.

SAGITTARIUS RISING

I was born facing outward,
feet already angled toward the door,
heart tethered to some far place
I haven't found yet but will.

They call it restlessness.
I call it faithfulness
to a destination
my soul remembers
even when my mind forgets.`,

'creative-haiku': `Sun in Leo shines —
golden mane, unshakable,
born to take the stage.

Scorpio Moon hides
in depths no sunlight can reach —
truth lives in the dark.

Rising Sagittarius —
arrow loosed toward the unknown,
never looking back.

Life Path Seven walks
the winding road to wisdom —
silence is the key.

North Node in Aries:
the soul learns to say "I am"
after lifetimes of "we."

Fire meets deep water —
steam rises between two worlds,
creating something new.`,

That underneath the stage, the ocean grew

Chorus:
I am golden depths and silver tides
The lion who knows how the phoenix cries
Don't ask me to choose between the fire and the deep
I was born to be both — I was born complete

Verse 2:
Sagittarius mornings, Scorpio nights
Life Path Seven searching for the light
North Node says be brave, South Node says be kind
I'm learning that the bravest thing is finding my own mind

Bridge:
When the crowd goes home and the curtain falls
I dive into the water where no light falls
And there, beneath the surface, I am more myself
Than any golden moment anyone has felt`,

'creative-screenplay': `INT. ROOFTOP BAR — GOLDEN HOUR

SARAH (34, confident but with eyes that see too much) stands at the edge of a rooftop, looking out over the city. The sunset paints everything gold. She's holding a glass of wine she hasn't sipped.

Her phone buzzes. She ignores it.

SARAH (V.O.)
Everyone thinks I love being up here. Center of attention. Queen of the room. And I do. I do. But there's this other part of me—

She looks down at the street below. Not with despair — with curiosity.

SARAH (V.O.)
—that wants to know what's underneath. Not the street. Everything. Every smile that's hiding something. Every "I'm fine" that isn't.

A STRANGER (30s, quiet, observant) approaches.

You look like someone who's about to solve a mystery or start a revolution.

'creative-character': `CHARACTER BIBLE: SARAH AURELIA KINGSTON

Full Name: Sarah Aurelia Kingston
Age: 34
Nickname: "The Golden Detective" (she hates this)

APPEARANCE: Tall, warm brown skin that seems to catch light. Hair worn differently every week — Leo Sun needs variety. Eyes that people describe as "too knowing." Wears gold jewelry always.

PERSONALITY: Magnetic, warm, genuinely interested in people — but reads them faster than they realize. Laughs loudly (Leo). Cries privately (Scorpio). Plans spontaneous adventures (Sagittarius Rising). Keeps a journal filled with questions (Life Path 7).

GREATEST STRENGTH: Making people feel seen while seeing everything they're hiding.

FATAL FLAW: Performing strength when she's falling apart.

SIGNATURE QUOTE: "I'd rather be terrifyingly honest than comfortably fake."`,

'creative-mythology': `In the time before calendars, when the gods named each soul before it was born, there came before the Council a soul so bright it burned the eyes of even the immortals.

"This one," said Apollo, "shall carry my fire. She will be a Leo — radiant, creative, a leader of hearts."

"And mine," whispered Persephone, queen of the underworld. "She will carry Scorpio's Moon. She will see what lives in shadows."

The council murmured. "Two such powerful gifts in one vessel? She'll tear herself apart."

But Chiron, the wounded healer, spoke last: "Or she will become the bridge that no one else can be. Send her with Sagittarius at her brow, to keep her moving. And the Seventh Path beneath her feet, to keep her seeking. And an arrow pointing North to Aries, so she learns that courage is not the absence of depth — it is its companion."

And so the soul was sent, twin-gifted, to a world that would need both her fire and her sight.`,

'cultural-translation': `SPANISH TRANSLATION (excerpt)

En la danza celestial de tu devenir, el gran Sol eligió plantar su semilla dorada en el signo del León. Eres fuego hecho carne, resplandor hecho forma. Tu corazón late con el ritmo ancestral de la soberanía — no la soberanía de la conquista, sino la soberanía de ser tan plena, tan inquebrantablemente tú misma, que los demás no pueden evitar orbitar alrededor de tu calidez.

Sin embargo, bajo esta superficie dorada, la Luna habla otro idioma. Se colocó en las profundidades de Escorpio — las aguas oscuras y quietas donde la verdad vive sin adornos.

YOUR SUN IN LEO — IKIGAI (生き甲斐)
Your reason for being burns bright like the golden temples of Kyoto at sunset. In Japanese tradition, this is not vanity but ikigai — the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what sustains you. Your Leo Sun IS your ikigai made visible.

YOUR MOON IN SCORPIO — MA (間)
Ma is the Japanese concept of negative space — the meaningful void between things. Your Scorpio Moon lives in the ma between what is said and what is meant. Where Western astrology calls this "emotional intensity," the Japanese eye sees beauty in those silences.

YOUR RISING IN SAGITTARIUS — TABI (旅)
Tabi means journey, but in Japanese culture, the journey itself IS the destination. Matsuo Basho, the great haiku poet, spent his life on the road. Your Sagittarius Rising is your eternal tabi.`,

(Correct: A — Your Sagittarius Rising + Scorpio Moon creates a curious-observer first response, before Leo Sun activates. If you answered D, you're in Leo performance mode, not your authentic first response.)

Question 2: When someone lies to you, you:
a) Confront them immediately
b) Say nothing but file it away forever
c) Give them the benefit of the doubt
d) Tell everyone about it

BOOK I: THE ORIGIN

Before the beginning, in the space between stars where souls are sculpted, there existed a Forge of Dual Flame — where the rarest souls were made from two opposing elements.

The soul called Sarah-Who-Would-Be was placed on the anvil of Leo. The solar hammer struck seven times (for her Life Path), and with each strike, a gift was embedded:

Strike 1: Radiance
Strike 2: Creative Vision
Strike 3: Courage
Strike 4: Generosity
Strike 5: Leadership
Strike 6: Self-Knowledge (this one hurt)
Strike 7: The Seeking (this one would never stop)

Then the lunar chisel, wielded by the Scorpio Moon-Mother, carved depths into the golden surface. Where the hammer gave warmth, the chisel gave sight. Where the hammer gave confidence, the chisel gave knowing.`,

'premium-ted': `TED TALK: "THE POWER OF BEING TWO THINGS AT ONCE"

[Walk to center stage. Pause. Smile.]

I've spent most of my life being told to pick one.

[Pause]

Pick one career. Pick one personality. Be confident OR be deep. Be the life of the party OR the quiet thinker. Be fire OR water.

[Walk to left]

When I was 25, I discovered something called a soul blueprint. It said I was a Leo Sun — bold, creative, needs to be seen — AND a Scorpio Moon — intense, private, needs emotional depth.

Instead of saying "pick one," it said: "you're both. That's your design."

[Walk to center]

That changed everything.

Because here's what I've learned: the most interesting people, the most creative solutions, the most meaningful relationships — they all live in the AND, not the OR.

How many of you have been told you're "too much"? Too intense? Too loud? Too sensitive? Too ambitious AND too emotional?

What if "too much" is actually "exactly right"?`,

'premium-language': `WEST AFRICAN GRIOT TRADITION

[Adapted as if spoken by a griot — keeper of oral history]

Listen well, child of the lion and the deep water. I am the keeper of your soul's story, passed through the mouths of those who came before.

YOUR SUN-NAME IS NANA ASANTEWAA — The Golden Sovereign
In the tradition of the Ashanti, your Sun in Leo makes you a born leader — not by force, but by the fire in your chest. The golden stool of the Ashanti represents the soul of the nation; you carry your own golden stool within you.

YOUR MOON-NAME IS MAMI WATA — The Deep Water Spirit
Your Scorpio Moon connects you to Mami Wata, the water spirit who sees through all masks. She is not evil, as the colonizers said. She is truth itself — uncomfortable, transformative, and ultimately healing.

YOUR PATH-NAME IS ANANSI'S SEVENTH THREAD
Life Path 7 connects you to Anansi the spider, the trickster-teacher who weaves stories to reveal wisdom.`,

'premium-career': `CAREER STRATEGY GUIDE

'premium-case': `PSYCHOLOGICAL CASE STUDY

CLIENT: Subject L-7 | Age: 34

PERSONALITY PROFILE (Big Five):
Openness: 92nd percentile (Life Path 7 + Sagittarius Rising)
Conscientiousness: 71st percentile (Mercury Virgo structure)
Extraversion: 85th percentile (Leo Sun dominant)
Agreeableness: 58th percentile (Scorpio Moon selectivity)
Neuroticism: 67th percentile (Sun-Moon square tension)

ATTACHMENT STYLE: Fearful-Avoidant
Subject presents as securely attached (Leo warmth) but under stress reverts to avoidant patterns (Scorpio withdrawal). Creates push-pull dynamic: warm approach followed by emotional distance when vulnerability threshold is crossed.

DEVELOPMENTAL ANALYSIS:
Early childhood (0-7): Mars Cancer — strong attachment to home/mother. Leo Sun recognition-seeking emerged by age 3.
Adolescence (7-14): Scorpio Moon fully activated. Discovery of emotional intensity others couldn't match.

THERAPEUTIC RECOMMENDATION: Integration-focused therapy addressing the Sun-Moon split. Encourage authentic vulnerability (Scorpio) within visible contexts (Leo).`,

'premium-songs': `CONCEPT ALBUM: "GOLDEN DEPTHS"
Genre: Indie Folk / Alternative Soul — 10 Tracks

TRACK 1: "LION HEART" (Opening)
Warm folk, acoustic guitar building to full band

They see the gold before they see the dark
They hear the roar before they hear the heart
I've been performing since before I knew
That underneath the stage, the ocean grew

Chorus:
I've got a lion heart, a lion heart
Beating bold in the center of me
I've got a lion heart, a lion heart
Not a cage — it's a key

TRACK 2: "DARK WATER" (The Moon)
Moody R&B, sparse piano, deep bass

Everybody sees the sunshine
Nobody sees the well
Where I keep the things I've carried
The things I'll never tell`,

ACT I, SCENE 1: THE DRESSING ROOM

[A theater dressing room. Mirrors everywhere. SARAH applies gold eyeshadow.]

SARAH: [To her reflection] You've got this. You always do. Smile. Shine.

[The reflection — LUNA — stops mirroring Sarah's movements.]

LUNA: What did THEY come for, Sarah? Or what did YOU?

SARAH: That's… not how mirrors work.

LUNA: It is when you've been avoiding me for thirty-four years.`
