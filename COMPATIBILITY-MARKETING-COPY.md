**Thread 2: Relationships**

1/ "Are we soulmates?" is the wrong question.

Ask instead:
"What are we here to teach each other?"

Let me explain:

2/ Not all deep connections are meant to last forever.

Some relationships are:
- Soul lessons (teach & release)
- Karmic contracts (heal & move on)  
- Twin flames (intense but challenging)
- Soulmates (easy & lasting)

3/ How do you know which one you're in?

12 mystical systems can tell you:
- Astrology (planetary alignments)
- Numerology (life path compatibility)
- Tarot (relationship spread)
- Past lives (karmic bonds)
- And 8 more...

4/ Our calculator analyzes all of this in 60 seconds.

- Dating someone new
- In a long relationship
