                        <p>Chiron represents your "wounded healer" archetype. The area where you carry the deepest wound 
                        becomes the area where you develop the greatest healing gift. Your pain is not punishment - 
                        it's preparation for the medicine you're meant to bring to the world.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Chiron Return (around age 50) is when Chiron comes back to its natal position. 
                        This is a profound time of healing your core wound and stepping fully into your healer role.</p>
                    </div>

                        ${name}, your wound is not your weakness - it's your wisdom waiting to be born. 
                        The very thing that broke you can become the medicine that heals others.
