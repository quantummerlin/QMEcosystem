2. **Stranger** (Upside Down Oracle) - `/stranger/`
3. **Genesis** (Frequency Generator) - `/genesis/`

## 💡 TOOLS THAT COULD BE "REBRANDED" VERSIONS

### Consider Creating:
1. **Stranger Tarot** - 80s horror themed tarot deck
2. **Stranger Angel Numbers** - Upside Down messages
3. **Stranger Sigils** - Glitch aesthetic sigils
4. **Genesis Sound Bath** - Frequency + meditation combo
5. **40Hz Focus Session** - Productivity timer + gamma waves

This creates **unique selling propositions** for each brand while keeping main hub comprehensive.

---

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ DO THIS:

1. **Elevate Four Pillars on Main Site**
   - Prominent hero section
   - Clear branding for each
   - "Explore Our Flagship Brands"

2. **Keep Pillars Focused**
   - Classic = Numerology + Astrology
   - Stranger = Themed version of Classic
   - Genesis = Healing Frequencies
   - 40Hz = Cognitive Enhancement

3. **Main Site = Comprehensive Hub**
   - ALL mystical/psychological tools
   - Gateway to Four Pillars
   - Resource library

4. **Create Clear Categories**
   - Branded Experiences (4 pillars)
   - Divination Tools
   - Sacred Tools
   - Personal Development
   - Compatibility
   - Resources

5. **Cross-Promote Strategically**
   - After Tarot → "Try Classic for numerology"
   - After Angel Numbers → "Try Genesis frequencies"
   - After Energy Leak → "Try 40Hz for focus"

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:

1. Don't dilute pillar brands with unrelated tools
2. Don't hide the four pillars in a menu
3. Don't create too many sub-brands (stick with 4)
4. Don't make navigation confusing

---

## 📊 CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

### ✅ WHAT'S WORKING:
