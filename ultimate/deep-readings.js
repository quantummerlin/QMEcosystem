        title: "The Emotional Warrior",
        hook: "This little one feels everything with urgency and fire — emotions hit fast, burn bright, and move through quickly. Their inner world is a battlefield of passionate feelings demanding immediate expression.",
        coreIdentity: "The Moon in Aries gives this child an emotional nature that's direct, courageous, and action-oriented. They don't hide how they feel — they show it instantly. When happy, they're exuberant. When upset, everyone knows immediately. This isn't drama; it's authentic, unfiltered emotional expression.",

        behavior: "When emotions arise, this child needs to move — running, jumping, doing something physical. They process feelings through action, not contemplation. Sitting still with big feelings is almost impossible and shouldn't be forced.",
        strength: "The capacity to feel fear and act anyway. This child has emotional courage that will serve them throughout life. They can face difficult feelings head-on rather than avoiding them. Their honesty about emotions creates genuine connections.",
        shadow: "The shadow pattern: reactive anger and emotional impulsiveness. They may lash out before thinking, say hurtful things in the heat of the moment, or start conflicts they later regret. Impatience with slower emotional processors.",
        integration: "Help them learn that pausing before reacting isn't weakness — it's wisdom. Channel their fiery emotions into physical outlets. Teach that other people's slower emotional pace isn't wrong, just different.",
        stress: "Under pressure, they become combative, impatient, and quick-tempered. They may pick fights, become physically aggressive, or refuse comfort that feels like weakness. The need for independence intensifies.",
        misread: "People may see them as too intense or angry when they're actually just being emotionally authentic in a world that often suppresses feelings. Their directness gets labeled as aggression.",
        relationships: "They need partners and friends who can handle their intensity without trying to calm them down. They respect emotional honesty and directness. Playing emotional games will lose their interest immediately.",
        growth: "Learning that vulnerability isn't weakness. Understanding that sometimes feelings need to be sat with, not acted on. Developing patience with others' emotional rhythms.",
        power: "When they fully own their emotional warrior nature, they become champions for others who can't speak up for themselves. They have the courage to feel what others fear to feel.",
        somatic: "They feel emotions in their head, face, and muscles — heat rising, jaw clenching, energy in the limbs demanding movement. Physical action is their emotional release.",
        parentGuidance: "Don't try to calm them down too quickly — let the feeling move through. Provide safe physical outlets. Never shame their intensity. Teach them words for feelings so they don't have to show everything physically.",

        misread: "People may see them as lazy or inflexible when they're actually processing at their natural pace, which is slower but deeper than most. Their need for routine gets labeled as rigidity.",
        relationships: "They need reliability and physical affection. Words alone don't register as love — they need touch, presence, and consistent behavior. They give the same steady devotion they need.",

        strength: "The ability to communicate emotions clearly and help others do the same. They can translate feelings into words, making the invisible visible. They bring understanding and perspective to emotional situations.",
        shadow: "The shadow pattern: intellectualizing to avoid feeling. They may talk about feelings without actually experiencing them, using words as a defense against emotional depth. Emotional inconsistency — mood changes without apparent cause.",
        integration: "Help them learn that not all feelings can be explained. Sometimes the answer is just to feel, not to understand. Ground mental processing in body awareness. Teach that staying with one feeling longer reveals its depth.",
        stress: "Under pressure, they become scattered, anxious, and talk excessively. Their mind races with multiple emotional interpretations. They may change their story about how they feel repeatedly.",

        relationships: "They need deep emotional security and attunement. Surface-level relationships leave them empty. They give care to receive care — learning that love exists without conditions is important.",
        growth: "Learning to separate their feelings from others'. Developing self-nurturing instead of only nurturing others. Building internal security that doesn't depend on others' emotions.",

// ULTIMATE COSMIC WRAP-UP
// ============================================

const COSMIC_WRAPUP_TEMPLATES = {
    introduction: `This soul arrived on ${'{DATE}'} at ${'{TIME}'} with a cosmic blueprint that has never existed before and will never exist again. Every planetary position, every aspect, every house cusp aligned in this unique moment to create ${'{NAME}'}.

What follows is not prediction — it's recognition. This reading doesn't tell ${'{NAME}'} who to become; it reveals who they already are. The stars don't control destiny — they illuminate the unique gifts, challenges, and potentials this soul carries.`,

    synthesis: `✨ THE CORE ESSENCE

At the center of this cosmic design is a ${'{SUN_SIGN}'} Sun — ${'{SUN_BRIEF}'}. This is the light ${'{NAME}'} is here to shine, the hero's journey they're here to walk.

But the Sun is only the visible surface. Beneath it flows a ${'{MOON_SIGN}'} Moon — ${'{MOON_BRIEF}'}. This is their emotional home base, the way they need to be loved, the inner sanctuary they'll return to throughout life.

And the world will first see them through their ${'{RISING_SIGN}'} Rising — ${'{RISING_BRIEF}'}. This is their costume for this life's play, the character they're learning to embody.

Life Path ${'{LIFE_PATH}'} weaves through everything: ${'{LIFE_PATH_BRIEF}'}. This is the numerological current that will carry them toward their destiny.`,

    parenting: `💫 FOR THE PARENTS AND GUIDES

This child chose YOU. Whether by cosmic design or beautiful accident, you are the ones entrusted with nurturing this unique soul. Here's what they need:

${'{NAME}'} needs ${'{CORE_NEEDS}'}.

They will thrive when ${'{THRIVE_CONDITIONS}'}.

They may struggle when ${'{STRUGGLE_CONDITIONS}'}.

The greatest gift you can give them is ${'{GREATEST_GIFT}'}.

Remember: Your job isn't to fix or change them — it's to create the conditions where their unique nature can unfold. Water the seed that's already there; don't try to make an oak tree into a rose.`,

    blessing: `🌟 THE FINAL BLESSING

To ${'{NAME}'}, on the day your cosmic blueprint became flesh:

You are not an accident. You are not random. The universe conspired for billions of years to create this exact moment — these exact parents, this exact time, this exact place, this exact soul.

You carry within you codes and gifts that the world needs. Not the world as it wishes you would be, but the specific world that needs exactly what you came to offer.

There will be challenges — your chart shows them clearly. But challenges are just invitations to grow into more of who you already are. Every hard aspect is a diamond in the rough. Every square and opposition is strength waiting to be forged.

Trust your cosmic blueprint. When in doubt, return to your core essence:
• Shine like your ${'{SUN_SIGN}'} Sun
• Feel like your ${'{MOON_SIGN}'} Moon  
• Enter the world like your ${'{RISING_SIGN}'} Rising
• Walk the path of your Life Path ${'{LIFE_PATH}'}

You are complete. You are enough. You are exactly what the universe ordered.

Welcome to Earth, little star. We've been waiting for you.

✨🌙⭐`
