# Quantum Merlin Microtool Template

## The Hidden Strengths Micro-Reading Pattern (Canonical)

This is the **default micro-reading layout** every tool should follow unless there's a strong reason not to.

---

## Section 1: Immediate Insight (Hook)

**Purpose:** Instant value. No fluff.

- 1–2 short paragraphs
- Present-tense
- Declarative, confident
- Feels "seen"

**Example pattern:**
> There's a part of you that operates quietly but decisively. It doesn't seek attention — it seeks impact.
>
> This is what makes people stay.

---

## Section 2: Naming the Pattern

**Purpose:** Cognitive clarity + emotional resonance.

- Give the insight a label
- Make it feel like something they've always known but never named

**Example:**
> This is a *latent stabiliser pattern* — the ability to hold things together when others fragment.

*This naming is sticky and highly shareable.*

---

## Section 3: How It Shows Up (Real Life Translation)

**Purpose:** Validation through recognition.

- 3–5 bullet points
- Concrete, everyday behaviors
- Neutral-to-positive framing

**Example:**
- You're often the calm one when things get chaotic
- People rely on you more than they say
- You tend to carry responsibility quietly

*This is where users think: "Oh… that's accurate."*

---

## Section 4: The Cost of Not Seeing It

**Purpose:** Gentle tension without fear-mongering.

- Short
- Framed as unconscious underuse, not failure

**Example:**
> When this strength isn't recognised, it can feel like you're doing more than your share — without acknowledgement.

*This creates motivation to go deeper.*

---

## Section 5: How to Work With It (Micro-Action)

**Purpose:** Empowerment, not instruction overload.

- 1–2 simple reframes or actions
- Internal, not behavioral commands

**Example:**
> When pressure rises, don't push harder — anchor. Your strength works best when you stabilise first.

---

## Section 6: Expansion Bridge (Standardized CTA)

**Purpose:** Turn insight into exploration. This should be **consistent across all micro-tools**.

**Template:**
> This [pattern/strength/insight] doesn't exist in isolation. It expresses differently across astrology, numerology, lunar cycles, and reality codes.

**Buttons:**
- 🌟 Apply to All Systems (primary CTA)
- 📚 Save to My Library
- 🧭 Explore Related Tools

## Implementation Rules

### Hard Rule:
> Same structure. Different voice, metaphor, and system lens.

### Tool Voice Guidelines:
| Tool | Voice Style |
|------|-------------|
| Hidden Strengths | Supportive, revealing |
| Energy Leak | Diagnostic, compassionate |
| Unconscious Contract | Reflective, pattern-breaking |
| Trust Radar | Orienting, grounding |
| Identity Split | Integrative, accepting |
| Power Avoidance | Empowering, confronting |

### Shape Never Changes
The 6-section structure remains consistent across all microtools.

---

## Language Consistency Guidelines

### Shift FROM:
- "Reading"
- "Prediction"
- "Analysis"

### Shift TO:
- **Insight** (what you discovered)
- **Pattern** (what recurs)
- **Navigation** (how to use it)
- **Self-mapping** (building your profile)

*This positions QuantumMerlin as a personal navigation system for consciousness — not a fortune-telling site.*

---

## Technical Implementation

### Intro Requirements:
1. Intro must be optional (max 1-2 sentences)
2. Skip must always advance immediately
3. No blocking loaders without timeout (15s max failsafe)
4. Fail gracefully (fallback text if something breaks)

### Safe Intro Pattern:
```html
<div class="intro-prompt">
    <p>This tool reveals a hidden pattern shaping your decisions. You'll need under 60 seconds.</p>
    <div class="intro-actions">
        <button onclick="beginTool()">Begin</button>
        <button onclick="skipIntro()">Skip intro</button>
    </div>
</div>
```

### End-of-Tool CTA Template:
```html
<div class="enhanced-cta">
    <h3>🔮 Apply This Insight Across the Nine Mystical Systems</h3>
    <p>This [insight type] doesn't exist in isolation. See how it expresses differently through astrology, numerology, lunar cycles, frequencies, and reality codes.</p>
    <div class="cta-buttons">
        <button onclick="goToEnhanced()">🌟 Apply to All Systems</button>
        <a href="library.html">📚 Save to My Library</a>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="next-tools-section">
    <h3>🧭 Explore Related Tools</h3>
    <p>Continue discovering patterns about yourself:</p>
    <!-- Tool cards grid -->
</div>
```

## What This Unlocks

Once this is standardized, you can:
- Auto-generate consistent micro-readings
- Swap system overlays (astrology / numerology / lunar) without rewriting
- Teach users how to read themselves
- Make the Library feel cumulative and intelligent
