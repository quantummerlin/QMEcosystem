## **0 - The Fool - Quantum Initiate of Avalon**

```
Create "The Fool" tarot card showing a young quantum initiate standing at the edge of a crystalline cliff, about to step into the mists of Avalon. They wear modern quantum-enhanced clothing in electric purple with circuit patterns, but carry an ancient oak staff entwined with glowing fiber-optic vines.

The cliff edge shows exposed quantum circuitry beneath ancient stone, where reality seams glow between past and future. Below, the Avalon mists swirl as quantum probability fields, with rose-shaped energy patterns blooming in the dimensional fog. A small quantum dragon made of light energy plays at their feet.

The background shows a split view: on one side, ancient Avalon with rose-covered stone circles; on the other, a futuristic quantum landscape with crystalline towers. An infinity symbol bridges both worlds in rainbow light. Above, stars cluster to form Arthurian constellations while data streams flow between them.

The border combines Celtic knotwork with quantum circuit patterns, corner medallions show the Holy Grail as quantum singularity, Excalibur as light blade, and the Rose of Avalon as dimensional portal.
