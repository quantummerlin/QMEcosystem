                <p>Your Midheaven, or MC (Medium Coeli), is the highest point in your birth chart—literally the point in the sky directly overhead at your birth. It represents your life's calling, career path, public reputation, and the legacy you're meant to build. While your Rising Sign shows how you appear to others personally, your MC shows how you're meant to appear to the world professionally and what you're here to achieve.</p>
