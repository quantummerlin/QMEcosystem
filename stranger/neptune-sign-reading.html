Your mysticism isn't passive contemplation—it's active pursuit. You find the divine through pioneering, initiating, and blazing trails where none existed. While others meditate on truth, you chase it. Your imagination is fire-forged, your compassion expressed through brave action.",
                external: "Others sense your spiritual urgency, your refusal to wait for enlightenment. You inspire through courage. Your mystical energy appears as action, as starting, as the first one into unknown territory.",
                behavior: "You spiritualize through doing. Your prayers are actions. You're drawn to warrior mystics, action-oriented practices, and finding transcendence through courage rather than stillness.",

You don't transcend the body—you find transcendence through it. Nature is your cathedral. Beauty is your prayer. You prove that matter and spirit aren't opposites—they're lovers. Your imagination is lush, sensory, and grounded.",

Your mysticism lives in ideas, in words that carry more than meaning, in connections that feel telepathic. You prove that the mind can be a channel for the infinite. Your imagination is verbal, quick, and connective.",
