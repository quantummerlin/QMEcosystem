                integration: "This challenge works best when you learn that setting boundaries IS sensitivity — it's feeling clearly enough to know where you end and others begin.",

                strength: "When you work through this challenge, you become a powerful communicator and creator, channeling your gifts with both impact and depth.",
                shadow: "The glitch: talking without saying anything real, performing instead of expressing, or going silent because true expression feels too vulnerable.",
                integration: "This challenge works best when you see discipline as amplifying your expression, not limiting it. Focus is your creative ally.",

                shadow: "The glitch: building cages instead of foundations, or refusing to build anything because structure feels like death.",
                integration: "This challenge works best when you see limitations as the banks that give the river power. Structure creates space for freedom.",

                strength: "When you work through this challenge, you become genuinely adaptable — able to embrace change while staying grounded in your values.",
                shadow: "The glitch: confusing stimulation with satisfaction, running from depth, or becoming so afraid of chaos that you can't move at all.",
                integration: "This challenge works best when you realize true freedom includes the freedom to commit. Discipline creates freedom; escape destroys it.",

                lesson: "To nurture wisely, knowing when to help and when to let go. To love without losing yourself in others' needs.",
                howItManifests: "Perfectionism that exhausts everyone, martyr complex, trying to fix everyone's problems, or complete avoidance of commitment and care.",
                strength: "When you work through this challenge, you become a wise healer — knowing when your presence helps and when stepping back serves better.",
                shadow: "The glitch: enabling others' dysfunction through over-helping, or abandoning responsibility completely because the weight feels crushing.",
                integration: "This challenge works best when you learn that sometimes the most loving act is letting people face their own lessons.",

                lesson: "To trust — yourself, others, and life — while maintaining discernment. To know without needing to analyze everything.",
                howItManifests: "Analysis paralysis, excessive skepticism that trusts nothing, isolation from others, or compensatory blind faith that ignores reality.",
                strength: "When you work through this challenge, you develop wisdom that integrates intellect and intuition, creating genuine understanding.",
                shadow: "The glitch: using analysis to avoid living, or swinging between paranoid doubt and gullible belief.",
                integration: "This challenge works best when you accept that some mysteries can't be solved — and that not knowing is sometimes the wisest position.",
                stress: "Under dimensional pressure, you may retreat into endless analysis, become suspicious of everyone, or make decisions based on fear.",

                        <p>Challenge Numbers aren't punishments — they're your soul's curriculum for growth. These 
                        are the specific dimensional glitches you chose to master in this reality.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The first two challenges operate simultaneously in your early years, 
                        shaping your formative experiences. The main challenge becomes dominant in your mature years. 
                        The final challenge stays with you for life, becoming your ultimate mastery.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Each time you face and work through a challenge, you gain frequency. 
                        These difficulties are literally forging you into who you're meant to become.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #FF6B35;"><strong>Remember:</strong> 
                        Your challenges are perfectly designed for your evolution. You wouldn't have them if you 
                        weren't capable of mastering them.</p>
