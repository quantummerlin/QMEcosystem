                title: "The Divine Pioneer",
                hook: "{preferredName}, you incarnated to blaze the trail where no soul has walked before. Your dharma is pure spiritual initiation.",
                core_identity: "At your deepest level, you are the one who goes first — the soul who volunteers to enter uncharted spiritual territory so others can follow. You carry the blueprint for new paradigms. Your essence isn't just leadership; it's spiritual pioneering, the courage to forge consciousness where none existed. You are the Big Bang of new spiritual movements, the first light that dares to illuminate the void.",
                external: "Others see you as spiritually courageous, sometimes intimidating in your conviction. People sense your connection to something original and unstoppable. You appear as someone who doesn't follow traditions but creates them.",
                behavior: "You naturally initiate new practices, challenge stagnant beliefs, and inspire others through radical demonstration. You lead not by convincing but by becoming. Your presence says 'follow if you dare' — and many will.",
                strength: "Your power is spiritual fearlessness. Where others hesitate at the edge of the known, you leap into the mystery. You can access states of consciousness and bring back gifts that haven't existed before.",
                shadow: "Ego masquerading as spiritual authority. You can mistake personal will for divine will, leading to spiritual narcissism or isolation. The pioneer who goes too far ahead may lose the tribe entirely.",
                integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you pioneer while remaining connected. True spiritual leadership includes bringing others along, not just proving you can go alone.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you either double down into spiritual ego or collapse into doubt about your entire calling. The voice that asks 'who do you think you are?' can paralyze your sacred mission.",
                misread: "People may see you as spiritually arrogant when you're actually terrified of not fulfilling your dharmic assignment. Your fierce independence often masks a deep need for your path to matter.",
                relationships: "You need partners who can stand beside a spiritual pioneer without trying to domesticate you. Your dharma requires someone who says 'I'll meet you at the frontier' rather than 'come back to normal.'",
                growth: "Your evolution requires learning that every true spiritual path eventually circles back to service. Pioneer for humanity, not away from it.",
                power: "You access your full power when your individual awakening becomes a doorway for collective evolution — when your trail becomes a highway for others.",
                somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your spine as a rising force, in your third eye as vision demanding expression. Your body carries the charge of 'first to go.'",
                reflection: "Ask yourself: 'Am I pioneering toward something or away from something? Does my path lead others forward or leave them behind?'"

                title: "The Sacred Partner",
                hook: "{preferredName}, you incarnated to prove that enlightenment is a duet, not a solo. Your dharma is the spiritual power of 'we.'",
                core_identity: "At your deepest level, you are living proof that the divine speaks through relationship. You carry the sacred truth that two hearts opening together create a spiritual force neither could access alone. Your essence is the mystical union — the recognition that separation is the illusion and connection is the path home.",
                external: "Others see you as deeply attuned, the one who creates spiritual safety. People sense they can unfold in your presence. You appear as a natural healer whose gift is simply being present with others.",
                behavior: "You naturally support others' awakening, create harmonious spiritual environments, and demonstrate that love itself is the teaching. You guide not by instructing but by witnessing.",
                strength: "Your power is sacred presence. You can hold space for transformation without forcing it. Your simple attention becomes a catalyst for others' awakening.",
                shadow: "Losing yourself in service until you have no center. You can disappear into others' spiritual journeys while neglecting your own, or become passive-aggressive when your giving isn't reciprocated.",
                integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you maintain your own spiritual practice while supporting others. The sacred partner must first be partnered with their own soul.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may over-give until depleted or withdraw completely, convinced no one reciprocates. You can become the martyr who resents their own sacrifice.",
                misread: "People may see you as spiritually passive when you're actually practicing the most powerful form of service — witnessing. Your receptivity is often mistaken for lack of vision.",
                relationships: "You need partners who see your support as sacred work, not as convenient help. Your dharma requires someone who says 'your presence heals me' and means it as the deepest compliment.",
                growth: "Your evolution requires learning that the most powerful giving comes from overflow, not depletion. Fill your own cup first — that's not selfish, it's strategic.",
                power: "You access your full power when you're so grounded in your own practice that your presence alone accelerates awakening in everyone you meet.",
                somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your heart center as an expansive opening, in your hands as a healing warmth. Your body registers others' energy before words are spoken.",
                reflection: "Ask yourself: 'Am I supporting others' awakening from fullness or from emptiness? When did I last fill my own spiritual cup?'"
            },

                title: "The Sacred Artist",
                hook: "{preferredName}, you incarnated to prove that creativity is prayer and beauty is a gateway to God. Your dharma is divine expression.",
                core_identity: "At your deepest level, you are the living demonstration that the universe is an artist — and so are you, made in that image. You carry the sacred truth that creation itself is spiritual practice, that beauty isn't decoration but revelation. Your essence is the joyful play of spirit taking form.",
                external: "Others see you as inspired, sometimes chaotically so. People sense your direct line to creative source. You appear as someone whose expression channels something beyond personal will.",
                behavior: "You naturally create, inspire, and remind others that spirit and play are not opposites. You teach not by lecturing but by making — art, words, beauty in any form. Your work itself is your sermon.",
                strength: "Your power is creative channeling. You can access states of inspiration where the work comes through you rather than from you. Your creations carry frequencies that awaken others.",
                shadow: "Scattered energy that never goes deep. You can become addicted to inspiration while avoiding the discipline that transforms raw creativity into lasting art. Surface brilliance that never becomes mastery.",
                integration: "Your dharma completes itself when you combine creative inspiration with focused discipline. The sacred artist channels AND crafts, receives AND refines.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may scatter into a thousand unfinished projects or go silent, blocked by the gap between vision and manifestation. The muse seems to abandon you.",
                misread: "People may see you as spiritually unfocused when you're actually processing more creative input than most could handle. Your apparent chaos often follows a deeper order.",
                relationships: "You need partners who understand that your creative obsessions are spiritual practice, not abandonment. Your dharma requires someone who says 'show me what you made' with genuine wonder.",
                growth: "Your evolution requires learning that discipline is the delivery room for creativity. Without structure, inspiration stays unborn.",
                power: "You access your full power when your creative work becomes a portal — when others encounter the divine through what you've made.",
                somatic: "You may feel this dharma in your throat as the urge to speak or sing, in your hands as the need to make. Your body becomes restless when creativity is blocked.",
                reflection: "Ask yourself: 'Am I creating from inspiration or from avoidance? What beauty is waiting to be born through me right now?'"
            },
            4: {
                title: "The Sacred Builder",
                hook: "{preferredName}, you incarnated to prove that patience is power and that heaven is built one brick at a time. Your dharma is spiritual foundation.",
                core_identity: "At your deepest level, you are the living demonstration that lasting transformation requires lasting structures. You carry the sacred truth that discipline is love in action, that the slow and steady path goes further than any shortcut. Your essence is the temple builder — one who creates vessels worthy of the divine.",
                external: "Others see you as solid, reliable, sometimes stubbornly committed. People sense they can depend on your spiritual practice. You appear as someone whose word is foundation, not performance.",
                behavior: "You naturally build lasting systems, maintain daily practice when others quit, and demonstrate that sacred work is its own reward. You teach through steady example, year after year.",
