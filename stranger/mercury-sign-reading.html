                external: "Others experience your communication as refreshingly direct. You say what you mean without diplomatic softening, which others appreciate for its honesty—even when it occasionally startles them.",
                behavior: "You're a mental pioneer who loves new ideas. The first phase of any concept excites you most—brainstorming, initiating, breaking new ground. Debates energize you; you love mental sparring.",
                strength: "Your ability to cut through complexity instantly. You grasp concepts by doing, not by reading endless theory. Hands-on experience teaches you faster than any lecture.",
                shadow: "The glitch: mental impatience and combativeness. You may interrupt others, dominate conversations, or dismiss ideas too quickly. Speaking before thinking creates problems.",
                integration: "Learn that listening is strategic, not passive. The best warriors gather intelligence before striking. Pause before speaking to multiply your impact.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you become more argumentative, interruptive, and mentally aggressive. You may pick intellectual fights unnecessarily.",
                misread: "People see aggression when you're actually expressing mental honesty. Your directness isn't hostility — it's respect for truth.",
                relationships: "You communicate passionately and directly. You need partners who can handle your bluntness and match your mental energy without taking offense.",
                growth: "Learn that some ideas need time to develop. Your instinct to act immediately on thoughts isn't always optimal. Strategic patience amplifies your mental power.",
                power: "When you fully own your quick-striker nature, you become the mental initiator — the one who sees and says what others are still processing.",
                somatic: "You feel thought in your head and face — heat rising, words pressing forward, physical urgency to speak.",

                core_identity: "Your Mercury is in Taurus, giving you a deliberate, practical, and grounded mind. You think slowly but thoroughly, and once you've formed an opinion, you hold it with remarkable tenacity.",
                external: "Others experience your communication as measured and concrete. You speak in practical terms, preferring real-world examples to abstract theories. Your words have weight because you don't waste them.",

                shadow: "The glitch: mental stubbornness and resistance to new ideas. You may cling to outdated thinking simply because it's familiar. Change feels like threat.",
                integration: "Learn that updating your thinking isn't betraying it. Mental flexibility can coexist with core stability. Some new ideas deserve the time you'd give old ones.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you become more rigid, slow to respond, and potentially uncommunicative. You may shut down rather than adapt.",
                misread: "People see slowness as stupidity. They underestimate the depth of your deliberate processing. Your conclusions are worth waiting for.",
                relationships: "You communicate with calm reliability. You say what you mean and mean what you say. Partners can count on your words.",
                growth: "Learn to entertain new ideas before judging them. Give novelty the same patient consideration you give the familiar.",
                power: "When you fully own your grounded nature, you become the voice of practical wisdom — turning abstract ideas into real-world solutions.",
                somatic: "You feel thought in your throat and jaw — words weighted, speech deliberate, physical solidity in expression.",

                core_identity: "Your Mercury is in Gemini—its home sign—giving you a quick, versatile, and endlessly curious mind. You're a natural communicator who learns, thinks, and expresses with remarkable agility.",
                external: "Others experience you as lively and varied. You can talk to anyone about anything, adapting your language to your audience. You're witty, articulate, and never at a loss for words.",
                behavior: "You're a mental omnivore who devours information. Everything interests you—at least briefly. Your mind loves variety and movement, juggling multiple projects simultaneously.",
                strength: "Your ability to connect disparate ideas. You understand by discussing, questioning, and examining multiple perspectives. Teaching others solidifies your own knowledge.",
                shadow: "The glitch: superficiality and mental restlessness. You may know a little about everything but master nothing. You might gossip or use words carelessly.",
                integration: "Learn that depth and breadth aren't enemies. Choose some subjects for mastery while keeping others for curiosity. Finish some of what you start.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you become more scattered, nervous, and prone to information overload. You may talk faster without saying more.",
                misread: "People see inconsistency as unreliability. Your natural rhythm of juggling is sophisticated — not scattered.",
                relationships: "Communication IS the relationship for you. You need partners who can match your verbal agility and intellectual range.",
                growth: "Learn that some ideas deserve sustained attention. Your breadth is strength; adding depth makes you unstoppable.",
                power: "When you fully own your acrobat nature, you become the connector — translating between domains and making understanding possible.",
                somatic: "You feel thought in your hands and nervous system — restless fingers, quick speech, energy demanding movement.",
                reflection: "Am I exploring or avoiding depth? What would sustained focus on one idea feel like?"
