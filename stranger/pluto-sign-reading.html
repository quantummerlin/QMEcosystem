Your power isn't passive—it strikes, initiates, pioneers. You don't wait for change; you become change through action. Where others hesitate, you charge. Your soul evolves through crisis that demands courage, through moments when action is survival.",
                external: "Others sense your transformative courage, your willingness to lead into unknown territory. Your power appears as initiative, as the strike that begins revolution, as courage others draw upon.",
                behavior: "You transform through doing. Your deepest changes come through action, not contemplation. Crisis activates your power, and you instinctively move toward what needs to be done.",
                strength: "Your gift is transformative initiative—the power to begin what needs beginning, to act when action is required. You can face what others fear because you move through fear, not around it.",
                shadow: "When unintegrated, your power becomes destructive rage, impulsive action that creates chaos, aggression mistaken for strength.",
                integration: "Balance action with wisdom. Your courage is sacred, but power without direction becomes destruction. Learn to strike when striking serves, to wait when waiting serves.",

                misread: "Others may see you as aggressive when you're actually courageously protective, or as reckless when you're responding to genuine crisis.",
                relationships: "You seek partners who can match your intensity. You transform relationships through passionate engagement, but must learn that not everything requires battle.",
                growth: "Your evolution involves learning that true power includes the power to not act. Conscious will, not reactive aggression, is your mastery.",

Your power works through resources, values, and the physical world. You don't just acquire—you transform the meaning of possession. Your soul evolves through loss and recovery, through discovering that true security comes from within.",

                stress: "Under pressure, you may become possessive, hoard resources, or cling to security at any cost. Material crisis can trigger your deepest fears.",

                relationships: "You seek partners who understand the spiritual significance of material reality. You transform relationships through building together, through shared resources and values.",

                core_identity: "With Pluto in Gemini (1884-1914), you belong to a generation that transforms through revolutionary communication. Your power works through words, ideas, and information. You don't just think—you transform how thinking works. Your soul evolves through having everything you believed destroyed, then rebuilt into truer understanding.",
                external: "Others sense your transformative mind, your words that can shatter or heal. Your power appears as insight, as ideas that change everything, as communication that reaches depths.",

                strength: "Your gift is intellectual transformation—the power to destroy false ideas, to communicate truths that liberate, to use the mind as a vehicle for deep change.",
                shadow: "When unintegrated, your power becomes manipulation through information, intellectual dishonesty, or using words as weapons of destruction.",
                integration: "Balance mental power with heart wisdom. Your words have power—use them for transformation rather than control.",
                stress: "Under pressure, you may become manipulative, overanalyze to avoid feeling, or use intellectual superiority as defense.",
                misread: "Others may see you as manipulative when you're actually perceptive, or as coldly intellectual when you're processing depth through ideas.",
                relationships: "You seek partners who can meet you mentally. You transform relationships through communication, through truth-telling that changes everything.",
