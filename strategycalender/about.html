            <h2>What Is Quantum Merlin?</h2>
            <p>Quantum Merlin is a strategic timing intelligence system that synthesizes multiple pattern recognition frameworks into one clear signal: when to push, when to wait, and when to pivot.</p>
            
            <p>We don't predict the future. We identify friction.</p>
            
            <p>Think of it as a weather forecast for your decisions. You wouldn't launch a boat in a hurricane, and you wouldn't stay docked during perfect sailing conditions. Quantum Merlin tells you what the conditions are—not what will happen.</p>

            <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
            <blockquote>"Millionaires watch price. Billionaires watch phase."</blockquote>
            
            <p>This isn't about mysticism. It's about meta-signal.</p>
            
            <p>Most people operate reactively—watching news, tracking prices, responding to events. They compete in crowded signal space where everyone sees the same information at the same time.</p>
            
            <p>Strategic thinkers operate architecturally—watching cycles, tracking macro forces, anticipating inflection points. They position before consensus exists.</p>
            
            <p>Quantum Merlin gives you the architectural view.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <h3>15+ Data Layers</h3>
            <p>We synthesize multiple pattern recognition systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Numerology</strong>: Life Path, Destiny, Soul Urge, Personal Year/Month cycles</li>
                <li><strong>Astronomical</strong>: Moon phases, planetary transits (slow planets only)</li>
                <li><strong>Geographic</strong>: Location-based resonance patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Archetypal</strong>: Chinese Zodiac, symbolic systems</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal</strong>: Natural energy cycles throughout the year</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Friction Detection</h3>
            <p>The magic isn't in any single layer—it's in the contradictions.</p>
            <p>When your Personal Year says "build" but your Personal Month says "release," that's friction. When your Life Path aligns with your current cycle, that's leverage.</p>
            <p>We identify these patterns and translate them into a 0-100 score.</p>
            
            <h3>Simple Output</h3>
            <p>Complex engine → Simple signal.</p>
            <p>You see: One color. One number. One sentence.</p>
            <p>No jargon. No mystical language. Just: "This month favors X. Avoid Y."</p>

            <h2>What This Is NOT</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Not fortune telling</strong>: We don't predict outcomes. We identify conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Not deterministic</strong>: A red flag doesn't mean failure. It means higher resistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Not a replacement for judgment</strong>: This is decision intelligence, not decision replacement.</li>
                <li><strong>Not dependency-creating</strong>: Use it as a compass, not a crutch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Honest Truth About Accuracy</h2>
            <p>Users report 70-80% alignment with lived experience.</p>
            <p>That's not perfect. It's not supposed to be.</p>
            <p>If you need 100% certainty, you're asking the wrong question. Life doesn't work that way.</p>
            <p>What Quantum Merlin does is tilt the odds. It helps you avoid stepping on landmines and recognize open doors.</p>
            <p>Think of it like this: A weather forecast isn't always right, but you still check it before planning a picnic.</p>

            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong>: Timing product launches, fundraising, hiring</li>
                <li><strong>Creatives</strong>: Maximizing output during peak creative windows</li>
                <li><strong>Executives</strong>: Strategic planning, major decisions, career moves</li>
                <li><strong>Investors</strong>: Understanding macro cycles and timing</li>
                <li><strong>Anyone</strong>: Who wants to work with their natural rhythms instead of against them</li>

            <h2>The Quantum Merlin Difference</h2>
            <h3>1. Multi-Layered Intelligence</h3>
            <p>We don't rely on one system. We synthesize 15+ data sources.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Honest Framing</h3>
            <p>We acknowledge friction. We don't promise miracles. We tell you when all options have high resistance.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Personalized Weighting</h3>
            <p>Your priorities matter. Health-focused people get different guidance than money-focused people.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Clean UX</h3>
            <p>No mystical clutter. No overwhelming charts. Just clear, actionable intelligence.</p>

            <h2>The Science (Sort Of)</h2>
            <p>Let's be clear: This isn't peer-reviewed science.</p>
            <p>But it's not random either.</p>
            <p>Numerology, astrology, and archetypal systems have survived thousands of years because they're useful pattern languages. They help humans make sense of complexity.</p>
            <p>We treat them as symbolic frameworks, not causal mechanisms. The moon doesn't make you creative—but tracking lunar cycles can help you notice your own creative rhythms.</p>
            <p>Think of it as applied pattern recognition, not mysticism.</p>

            <h2>The Creator</h2>
            <p>Quantum Merlin was created by <strong>Wayne Michael</strong>, a pattern recognition specialist and strategic timing researcher.</p>
            <p>After years of studying numerology, astrology, and decision science, Wayne built this system to answer one question:</p>
            <blockquote>"How do I know when to push and when to wait?"</blockquote>
            <p>The answer became Quantum Merlin.</p>
