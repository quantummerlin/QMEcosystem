PROFILE & LIBRARY SYSTEM UPGRADE PLAN
======================================

Current Issues:
- Only saves name and birth date (no place of birth)
- Can't save/load profiles easily
- No primary profile concept
- Library is hard to browse
- Can't switch between profiles

New Features to Add:
1. Profile Manager
   - Save profiles with: Name, DOB, Place of Birth
   - Set primary profile (auto-loads on page)
   - Quick profile switcher dropdown
   - Edit/delete profiles

2. Enhanced Library
   - Filter by profile
   - Better visual cards
   - Search functionality
   - Export/import capability
   - Preview pane

3. Integration
   - "Load Profile" button next to form
   - Auto-save last used profile
   - Profile selector in library view

Implementation Steps:
1. Add profile storage structure in localStorage
2. Create profile management modal
3. Add profile selector dropdown in header
4. Enhance library with profile filtering
5. Add "Load" buttons in library to populate form with that forecast's profile

This will be a significant upgrade. Should I proceed with implementation?
